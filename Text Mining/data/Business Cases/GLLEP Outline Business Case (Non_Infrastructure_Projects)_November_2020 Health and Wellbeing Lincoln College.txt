Project Summary
(Please keep as  brief as possible as this will be used for publicity purposes and uploaded onto the GL LEP website)i) Economic Impact
Lincoln College has a compelling vision to kick-start the regeneration of the City Centre and deprived Monks Road corridor into the city centre through the purchase, refurbishment and use of properties to directly contribute to LEP priority themes, namely health and care, business growth, regenerating housing and skills creation. 
The College is seeking Capital Funding for Phase 1 of the project to create a community Health and Wellbeing Centre (HWBC) which will help to meet the demand for wellbeing services from employers and the wider community across the region. The regeneration scheme will be employer-led; working hand-in-hand with our Construction College with students playing an integral part in the refurbishment and design of the property.
The focus of the HWBC will be on mental health conditions as they account for 56% of all sickness absences, with the aim of both reducing the £283m annual sickness bill of GLLEP employers and increasing the GDP of the region by improving attendance and productivity.
Modelling by the Centre for Mental Health (Covid 19 and the nation’s mental health October 2020) predicts that up to 10 million people will need either new or additional mental health support as a direct consequence of the Covid 19 crisis. 
The HWBC will deliver health related and resilience focused qualifications and courses that are designed to help learners better understand and manage conditions that might cause them to be absent from work, as well as providing preventative support services and access to professionals.
The HWBC will also provide an inclusive and accessible environment to holistically address and promote the health and wellbeing of young people and the wider community; providing opportunities for collaboration and a venue for the ‘one stop shop’ delivery of wider support services.
It will provide: 
- Deliver employer led accredited training programmes including Level 2 and 3 Counselling and Mental Health First Aid qualifications.
- Work with LPFT  and clinicians to develop and deliver short non-accredited and online courses e.g. developing resilience and boundary management.
- Provide a base for occupational health provision.
- Provide clinic space for services such as NLP Coaching.
- Provide space for local support groups e.g. Slimming World, Stop Smoking etc.
- Provide space for small ‘exercise’ classes e.g. yoga, breath work.
- Offer relaxation rooms for employer and community use.
-  Provide healthy eating, confidence and sleep management workshops.
- Offer a link to the Alternative Medicine/ Therapy Higher Education programmes currently delivered by Lincoln College to support progression. 
- Create opportunities for work shadowing for those interested in working within Counselling.
- Provide a base for college counsellors supporting Lincoln College learners.
- Provide a proactive approach to providing preventative support to post 14 students.
The project will provide c750sqm of floor space to create a HWBC in partnership with the Lincolnshire Partnership NHS Trust (LPFT) and provide support based on the five ways to wellbeing:
* Be active
* Connect with others
* Keep learning
* Take notice 
* Give
In addition, having consulted with employers in the Health and Care sector, we will introduce two brand new courses that will address the need for new qualified counselling staff, to meet the increased level of demand for these services. 
They will also act as a pathway to Higher Education, specifically the BA(Hons) Psychology and Counselling degree at Bishop Grosseteste University (BGU) and new Apprenticeship standards at Level 6 and 7 e.g. Level 6 Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner.
The project will deliver economic impact at all levels by:
* Providing individuals with access to qualifications and a routeway to higher level learning and employment opportunities.
* Supporting local businesses across all sectors to increase productivity through addressing staff wellbeing and reducing levels of absenteeism.
* Increase the GDP of the region by increasing levels of mental health resilience of the region’s workforce through specific training.
* Supporting some of the recruitment and training needs of LPFT. 
* Offering access to Continued Professional Development locally to staff of businesses in Greater Lincolnshire.
* Revitalising the City Centre / Monks Road corridor, a focal point of Lincoln, and attracting other investment to one of the most deprived wards in Greater Lincolnshire.
* Providing individuals with access to support groups, experts and preventative support services through a collaborative one-stop shop approach.

The new facilities are expected to engage over 180 local businesses in skills training. 
Furthermore, we anticipate that more than 150 of our Construction College students will benefit from the opportunity to refurbish and make good the property.

ii) Delivery of Greater Lincolnshire LEP Priorities (including the Local Industrial Strategy and Covid Recovery Plan)

Supporting Organisations

Delivery Partners

The HWBC will be managed by Lincoln College with support and training being delivered by the college itself and other strategic partners, such as LPFT and local GPs.

We will work with a local Pharmacy to provide a shop unit to ‘front’ the centre; removing the stigma associated with entering a Health and Wellbeing centre.

Supporting Organisations

Supporting organisations will not be involved in the direct delivery of the services but will provide referrals and other complementary provision. They will comprise the Recovery College, BGU, Active Lincolnshire, the Voluntary and Community Sector, Chamber of Commerce, Lincoln BIG, trade unions, and schools and educational establishments.

The City of Lincoln Council and Lincolnshire County Council are both supportive of the prospects of this project and the potential regeneration of the City Centre / Monks Road area. 

The Independent Defence Authority have also expressed their support for the project and an interest in accessing Level 2 training programmes to meet their staff development and support requirements.

In the longer term, the College would look to build on existing relationships with international partner, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TUTCM), China. We are currently discussing a proposition to run a joint teaching programme delivering courses ranging from CPD seminars to full degree courses in Acupuncture and Herbalism.  The collaboration will add value and enhance the teaching and learning experience for both teachers and students on both sides through activities of teacher training and student exchanges. Local and national communities would benefit from the alternative medical treatments available and Chinese culture experience. 



1. Deliverability1.1 What is the Project? 
(Please summarise in 100 words or less.  More specific details can be provided in other sections of the form) 
The purchase and refurbishment of a property within the City centre / Monks Road, Lincoln, to create a Health and Wellbeing Centre that will address the needs of Greater Lincolnshire employees to reduce levels of absenteeism and increase productivity of the region’s workforce. The Centre will collaborate with specialists in the development and delivery of health and wellbeing programmes to address workforce training and development needs, whilst also offering counselling and treatment services, exercise classes and access to partner services and specialised relaxation rooms . The Centre will also provide an inclusive and accessible environment to holistically address and promote the health and wellbeing of young people and local residents.1.2 How will the project be delivered, to and by whom? 
Briefly explain: 
* The specific activities that will be undertaken as part of the project 
* Who are the target beneficiaries? 
* Where the project’s activity will take place 
The project will support Lincolnshire County Council plans for regeneration of the City centre /Monks Road area through the purchase and refurbishment of a property to create a Health and Wellbeing Centre that will be accessible by employers and their employees, young people and the wider community. Students from our Construction College will also play an integral part in the refurbishment and redesign of the property.

The Centre will be equipped with a suite of training, consultation, treatment, exercise and relaxation/tranquillity rooms. The Centre will allow users to access alternative/ complementary therapies and services including massage, herbal therapeutics, acupuncture, hypnotherapy and Cognitive Behaviour Therapy. It will provide a base for external support services and occupational health provision.



Target beneficiaries
The main focus of the HWBC will be on supporting employers and their employees; responding to the findings of our research and analysis of Lincolnshire skills and health and wellbeing strategies including the  SEP, LIS, Covid Recovery Plan, Joint Strategic Needs Assessment and Lincolnshire Sustainability and Transformation Plan.
The College are also mindful of the health and wellbeing needs of young people and the wider community, particularly in relation to mental health which has been impacted by the pandemic. In developing this project proposal, we have worked on the assumption that 75% of activities supported by the HWBC will be focused on activities that respond to employer demand, the remaining activities will focus on supporting young people and the wider community. In light of the impact of Covid-19 including increased levels of unemployment within the county, resulting financial hardship and coping with long periods of isolation the balance of activities may have to flex to provide an increased focus on supporting the community. This may include delivery of activities and support to overcome anxieties associated with re-integration with society, seeking employment in an alternative sector and coping with significant change.

GLLEP Employers and their workforce 
- Supporting the workforce through access to services, including providing a base for occupational health provision.
- Upskilling in mental health awareness, emotional resilience  and boundary management, with programmes specifically developed for employees in HR and Leadership and Management and delivered in association with LPFT. 
- Delivering employer led accredited training programmes including Level 2 and 3 Counselling and Mental Health First Aid qualifications.
- Supporting the development of health and wellbeing strategies and operations.

 The focus on activities to support young people will include:
- Developing a proactive approach to engaging those who are 14+ in preventative, rather than reactive, activities. This group is identified as a priority sector by the LPFT and research has identified that their mental health has been significantly impacted by Covid 19. The Centre for Mental Health reports (October 2020) that there were 3.25 million young people aged 11-16 years kept at home during lockdown. Depression and anxiety are the two predicted diagnoses to emerge, with 458,922 children needing help for depression, and 407,623 for anxiety.
- Delivering programmes around emotional resilience and general wellbeing including healthy eating, sleep, physical activity and connectivity.
- Programmes will work with young people to, for example, develop strategies for coping with exam stress and an understanding of the need to look after their health and wellbeing . It is envisaged that through doing this we can support a more resilient school age population and improve their performance during examinations leading to the achievement of higher grades at GCSE and A Level, increasing both the number of the working age population with a Level 2 or 3 qualification and progression in to apprenticeship programmes and higher level learning.
This activity will support raising levels of attainment and achievement of higher level skills and provide a more resilient future workforce.

Community - Residents with pre-existing mental health issues or requiring support post Covid.
- Providing access to health and wellbeing support that complements existing services.
- Working collaboratively with local support groups and health care professionals to develop a ‘one stop shop’ for accessing Slimming World, Stop Smoking
- Provide space for small ‘exercise’ classes e.g. yoga, breath work and relaxation rooms.
- Provide healthy eating, confidence and sleep management workshops.
- Delivering courses that are designed to help individuals better understand and manage conditions that might cause them to be isolated from their community and out of work, as well as providing preventative support services.




2. Project Need2.1 Why is the project needed in Greater Lincolnshire?
We have spent considerable time engaging and consulting with local employers, Lincolnshire County Council, the LPFT and other stakeholders to design a project which responds to the needs of Greater Lincolnshire.

It responds to employers’ needs to improve productivity and LEP priorities. 
The project will support an increase in the growth and productivity of the region  across all the GLLEP priority sectors. 
This will be achieved through increasing access to health and wellbeing support for GLLEP employers and their workforce through delivering a collaborative and accessible service.
The HWBC will address barriers to engagement due to stigma and support employers to reduce absenteeism in the workplace as a result of mental health and stress related instances. Mental illness accounts for over half of work absences (56%) – 15.4 million working days were lost in 2017 according to the Health and Safety Executive.  On average an employers’ sickness bill is £570 per person per annum. Based on NOMIS figures for those in employment in Greater Lincolnshire during the period April – March 2019, 497,300, this equates to a sickness bill in excess of £283million for Greater Lincolnshire employers. As mental illness accounts for 56% of these absences the cost to employers equates to £158million per annum.

It supports raising levels of attainment and achievement of higher level skills  - Young People
The project will also develop a proactive approach to engaging those who are 14+ in preventative activities. Delivering programmes around emotional resilience and general wellbeing including healthy eating, sleep, physical activity and connectivity. It is envisaged that through doing this we can support a more resilient school age population and improve their performance during examinations leading to the achievement of higher grades at GCSE and A Level, increasing both the number of the working age population with a Level 2 or 3 qualification and progression in to apprenticeship programmes and higher level learning.
GLLEP area has good GCSE results; the proportion of school leavers obtaining a Level 2 qualification is amongst the highest in England. Yet, the most recent statistics show that the region does not maintain this competitive advantage. Fewer 16 to 24-year-olds are qualified to Level 3 and Level 4 when compared with the UK average. The proportion of 16 to 64-year olds in Greater Lincolnshire with no qualifications is 6% higher than the England average, and, despite the exemplary school leaver achievements, this gap is predominantly amongst the  16 to 34-year-olds. Participation in vocational learning is increasing  but has traditionally been lower than the national average.

It enables major FE providers to improve equality of provision across Greater Lincolnshire:
The need for this project is highlighted in The DfE Area Review of Greater Lincolnshire (Final Report August 2017). This identified the need for change to ensure that FE provision responds to the needs of individuals and employers, with local authorities and LEPs setting out the following education priorities for the area:
- Be accessible to all.
- Provide equal opportunities for the most vulnerable young people, including high needs learners and those with disabilities.
- Meet the needs of the growth sectors identified by the LEPs.
- Meet the demands of the labour market and reflect shrinking working age population and a 16-18 cohort that will not grow until 2020.
- Reflect the need to shift towards higher level skills.
- Provide a different approach to employer engagement so that the curriculum offer at colleges better meets employer needs.

It responds to national and local strategies and priorities around health and wellbeing  and complements existing services:
Offering practical support to the delivery of the Lincolnshire Sustainability and Transformation Plan.
Links to the needs outlined in the Joint Strategic Needs Assessment. Mental Health has been identified as a key priority in the Joint Health and Wellbeing Strategy for Lincolnshire approved by the Health and Wellbeing Board in June 2018.
Complements the support that is available through the Recovery College in partnership with Lincoln College in both Lincoln and Gainsborough.
Supports the recruitment and training requirements of LPFT, who have an ageing workforce and encounter challenges in recruiting new staff, as found in the NHS generally where, on average, all vacancies are advertised six times before being filled.
Aligned to and supports the government planning guidance (2017-19) which prioritised mental health as a “must do”.
Supports the delivery of the short and medium term Covid recovery plan and address the risks posed by Covid 19 on the Greater Lincolnshire economy,  businesses and the wider community. Meeting the employment and training needs of the current and future workforce in relation to mental health and resilience and providing access to support for mental health and wellbeing delivered by statutory organisations and private service providers.

2.2 What research or evidence has been undertaken to demonstrate the need, demand or impact of this project?  Please attach or provide links to completed studies and impact assessments where available.
The College has engaged extensively with employers and stakeholder groups representing the identified priority sectors in and around Lincoln. We conducted our research via:
* Focus groups
* Roundtable discussions
* 1-2-1 conversations
* Attendance at employer workforce groups
* Consultation with representative bodies and public sector departments including LPFT
* Desk based research.
The NHS Lincolnshire Sustainability and Transformation Plan has been developed to respond to the strategic challenges facing the health service and will fundamentally change the way the NHS operates. The project can directly support the following STP objectives

* Keeping people well and healthy
* High quality and effective services
* Develop Multi-speciality Community Providers alongside integrated strategic commissioning arrangements.
During consultation with the LFPT they identified a need to:

* Upskill employees in HR and Leadership and Management roles so that they are better placed to support the workforce and address levels of absenteeism as a result of mental health issues.
* Develop a proactive preventative approach to supporting the health and wellbeing of young people aged 14+.
* Create training and awareness programmes with clinicians e.g. boundary management and use of innovative technology to deliver them in an accessible manner.

In order to help meet employer needs, the project will create a partnership led curriculum design to ensure that the academic offer is employer-led and responsive to their needs.  

The College has followed research undertaken on the impact Covid 19 on mental health and wellbeing including the Modelling by the Centre for Mental Health (Covid 19 and the nation’s mental health October 2020) predicts that up to 10 million people will need either new or additional mental health support as a direct consequence of the Covid 19 crisis and that of the 3.25 million young people aged 11-16 years kept at home during lockdown, it is predicted that 458,922 need help for depression, and 407,623 for anxiety. The centre will deliver health related and resilience focused qualifications and courses that are designed to help learners better understand and manage conditions that might cause them to be absent from work / education, as well as providing preventative support services and access to professionals.



2.3 Please explain how the project will deliver the strategic objectives of the Local Enterprise Partnership area and will demonstrate alignment with other local growth priorities.  Please include how you will deliver against the Local Industrial Strategy and the  Covid Recovery Plan
How will the project support the key principles of sustainable development – including Equality and Diversity assessments?  Will the scheme provide Net Zero Carbon solutions as part of its delivery?
Will it support the government's Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution
The project is designed to focus on meeting the needs of Greater Lincolnshire with a focus developing a health and wellbeing service that is accessible by employers across all GLLEP /LIS priority sectors. The project will support these areas as follows:

* Direct response to the employers’ needs: The project responds to gaps in provision around supporting mental health highlighted by employers (through research, interviews and focus groups and feedback from the LPFT). In response to this feedback, we will work with clinicians to create and deliver a series of non-accredited programmes. These programmes will be accessible on line and will address issues associated with time out of the workplace for SMEs and rural accessibility to skills development solutions.

* Enhanced information, advice and guidance: The project will support the development of the skills base through enhanced information, advice and guidance, new qualifications and health and wellbeing related Apprenticeship Standards. The project will deliver employer led accredited training programmes including Level 2 and 3 Counselling qualifications and link to the Alternative Medicine/ Therapy Higher Education programmes currently delivered by Lincoln College. Supporting progression, as well as creating a pathway to the BA (Hons) Psychology and Counselling degree at Bishop Grosseteste University and developing Apprenticeship Standards delivery at Level 6 and 7 e.g. Level 6 Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner.

* Workforce: The project will meet the changing employment and training needs of the Greater Lincolnshire workforce (current and future) in the context of Covid 19; providing mental health and resilience training and access to support for mental health and wellbeing services delivered by statutory organisations and private service providers.

* Productivity growth: Reducing the cost and impact of absenteeism in the workplace as a result of mental health and stress related instances. Mental illness accounts for over half of work absences (56%) – 15.4 million working days were lost in 2017 according to the Health and Safety Executive.  On average the employers’ sickness bill is £570 per person per annum. Based on NOMIS figures for those in employment in Greater Lincolnshire during the period April – March 2019, 497,300, this equates to a sickness bill in excess of £283million for Greater Lincolnshire employers. As mental illness accounts for 56% of these absences the cost to employers equates to £158million per annum. Reducing absenteeism will increase a company’s productivity levels.
Raising levels of attainment and achievement of higher level skills to address skills shortages. Through delivering programmes around emotional resilience and general wellbeing including healthy eating, sleep, physical activity and connectivity that are targeted at young people aged 14+, it is envisaged that we can support a more resilient school age population and as a result improve their performance during examinations. Leading to the achievement of higher grades at GCSE and A Level, increasing both the number of the working age population with a Level 2 or 3 qualification and progression in to Apprenticeship programmes and higher level learning. Increasing the number of 16 to 24-year-olds who are qualified to Level 3 and Level 4 and participation in vocational learning.
The project will also directly drive up productivity through highly trained Apprenticeships that closely match industry requirements. Research shows that firms employing apprentices will benefit from increased long-term productivity. A typical apprentice delivers productivity gains of over £10,000 per annum. Even before an apprentice is fully qualified, many businesses will see economic benefits of offering Apprenticeships. Figures show that while training, each apprentice in England is estimated to deliver an average positive net gain of £1,670 per annum to their employers. (Economic impact 2015 UK GOV commissioned study).

* Supporting sustainable development: The project will support the key principles of sustainable development by providing opportunities to allow everyone to fulfil their potential. It will provide employers with the skills they demand and require - now and in the future. Throughout the project we will:
o Carry out Equality and Diversity assessments.
o Promote equality and diversity.
o Monitor the use of resources.
o Provide accessible training and skills provision.
o Meet the needs and aspirations of young people and the community. 
Ensure that best practice is disseminated as widely as possible.

4. Options Analysis4.1 Why should the project receive LEP funding?
The project aligns with the GLLEP Strategic Economic Plan.

The project is of strategic importance to GLLEP both as a standalone HWBC and in the broader context of kick-starting the regeneration of the City Centre or Monks Road which is a focal point in the city of Lincoln. Monks Road is at the heart of the Abbey Ward which suffers from significant deprivation and the refurbishing one of the key buildings for the benefit of the local community would generate interest and potential investment in further phases of our regeneration project. 

It will provide skills and support solutions to effect greater economic growth, productivity and competitiveness.

•	The project will support the Health and Care (NHS, LPFT) sector to deliver their priorities. 
•	It supports business productivity and economic growth across all priority sectors. 
•	The project will develop and deliver training that responds to employer needs in relation to health and wellbeing and develops a talent pipeline that provides a pool of skilled people to meet skills gaps and growth potential within the Health and Care sector. 
•            The project supports the delivery of the short and medium term Covid Recovery Plan; tackling current workforce and sector challenges and the need to meet changing employment and training needs. Supporting the development of a resilient workforce.
•	This project provides an opportunity for the LEP to invest capital in an FE infrastructure development that will have a transformational impact and make a significant contribution to the achievement of the LEP priority for growth.

Employer-led
•	Lincoln College mission statement is to be ‘Employer led; producing a highly skilled and productive local workforce.” 
•	We have undertaken extensive consultation in the development of this application. The project is a direct response to employers’ needs and has been developed in conjunction with LPFT to address the gaps which they have highlighted in the delivery of skills training and mental health support. 

Lincoln College has been formulating and driving forward the concept of this project for over one year and has conducted extensive research with employers and stakeholders, including the City of Lincoln Council, Lincolnshire County Council and the LPFT, and developed robust partnerships.

The involvement of our employer-led Construction College in the regeneration project will also ensure that local construction firms benefit from the extensive practical experience received by their new recruits.









4.2 What other funding or delivery mechanisms have been considered to deliver the proposed activity?

Potential funding opportunities are limited for a project of this scale. 

The College has been working closely with its bank relationship manager to explore options for funding the project. Those options range from a secured loan, to a renegotiation of existing facilities in conjunction with utilising available cash reserves. 
4.3 Additionality: What will the project deliver above and beyond what would happen anyway?
The project will: 
* Work in collaboration with clinicians and other mental health specialists to create and deliver non accredited training programmes.
* Work with a local Pharmacies to provide space to ‘front’ the centre; providing an accessible venue without the stigma associated with accessing mental health services. 
* Train employees working in a HR or line management capacity in mental health awareness and boundary management so that they are better able to support the workforce to reduce absenteeism and improve productivity; enhancing communication skills and transforming behaviours. 
* Provide a facility for use by employers to deliver Occupational Health services.
* Provide investment in new resources and facilities for academic delivery and employer training to meet the skills needs of employers in the Health and Care sectors.
* IAG – The College currently provides Matrix accredited IAG support to individuals and businesses. Investment in the HWBC will provide a facility that will engage, inspire and motivate; taking service users on a journey to employment / sustained employment.
* Serve as a catalyst for City centre / Monks Road regeneration projects, driving interest and private investment in Phases 2 and 3.
* Provide hands-on training for over 150 Construction College students as they design and refurbish the HWBC.
Existing ESF SSE, ESFA AEB and Apprenticeships budgets will continue to be used to engage employers and guide and advise learners.




4.4 Scalability: What would happen if reduced LEP funding was available?
If reduced funding was available, the College would be unable to complete the purchase and refurbishment of the property and therefore, the project would not happen.

6.2 Please describe the rationale and assumptions you have made in establishing the outputs and results which will be achieved. This must link clearly to the project’s activity and objectives. Please explain your method for calculating the target levelsLincoln College has extensive experience of budgeting and forecasting performance outputs, with a dedicated team of staff working with our Director of Performance and Planning, who will develop a budget for recruitment, retention and achievement in every curriculum area and across all types of delivery. Their job is to work with departments to develop a budget for recruitment, retention and achievement in every curriculum area and across all types of delivery. Once the budget has been agreed, they will provide Management Information to support the delivery managers track and forecast performance outcomes throughout the year. The Performance and Planning team were consulted extensively in the formulation of the outcome proposals of this project.
6.3 Please outline how the project will gather and assess evidence of outputs and results, in line with the LEP's Monitoring and Evaluation Framework 
Lincoln College’s Group Director of IT & Projects will lead the project, he will be responsible for implementing a multi-disciplinary project delivery team ensuring that evidence of outputs and results of agreed monitoring metrics are gathered and assessed in line with the LEP’s monitoring and evaluation framework.
Lincoln College measures a variety of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to monitor and improve performance and assess evidence of outputs; these are recorded on the organisations Top Level Scorecard. 
These measures are interrogated and challenged at various levels, and in various forums. The groups, reviews and processes outlined below are integrated into the improvement cycle, ensuring that the College meets the needs of learners and employers. Regular assessment of success in the above areas allows us to make quick responsive decisions where there are tactical needs. They also allow us to formulate considered and evidence strategies for the future. These include our Employer Engagement Strategy which reflects the local skills needs and LEP priority sector areas, Change Management programmes and staff objectives and appraisals. 
Executive Leadership Team. Key measures are interrogated and discussed monthly by senior managers, based on the scorecard and dashboard.
Quarterly Performance Reviews. A formal review of performance in all relevant areas, led by the Chief Executive, is intended to provide assurance and development in key areas, with agreed actions to make improvements where necessary.  
Managing Directors Reviews. Monthly reviews of performance, led by the MD of Education and Training and attended by the Director of Apprenticeships, Director of Employer Provision and Director of Planning and Performance. 
Monthly Funding Meetings. Focused on important funding and compliance KPIs, provides scrutiny over learner numbers and income performance, and mitigating actions are agreed here where required. College targets are to exceed National averages timely and overall framework achievement by 3%.
Fortnightly Review Meetings. The Head of Apprenticeships & WPL and Training & Skills Leads meet fortnightly to review all data, applications, enrolments, retention and achievements. Any problems are discussed, and support is put in place for ‘at risk learners’.  Apprenticeship data and KPIs are reviewed by the Employer Provision management team on a monthly basis.

KPIs form the basis of both the College’s Apprenticeship strategy and operational plan as well as individual performance objectives. The majority of the College’s KPI’s align with the LEP’s monitoring and evaluation framework, however if there is something more specific we would comply and ensure that monitoring is established.  There are several key measures evaluated that cover three important areas: Responsiveness to Employer Need, Quality for Learners, and Destination Outcomes.  
There are a number of factors and measures we consider when setting outcome targets. Additionally, these targets may be set at different levels – for example at individual/learner, employer, sector and regional level. 
Impact Measurement and Outcome Analysis: Learners and Employers. Learner impacts are measured individually and across different data sets. Individually, we consider the impact on the learner of achieving the qualification in the context of their ability to occupy their role successfully and deliver value to their employer progression to the next level of learning. These are measured and recorded at the exit interview with the learner and employer and tracked through their individual learner record. 
We also consider the improved employability and behavioural skills, and their impact. This will be measured through enhanced job roles ie promotion or increased responsibility, progress towards these goals will be recorded at 10 weekly progress reviews and final progression at exit interview, all reviews are completed with the employee and the employer and tracked and recorded within the Employer Responsive Team. 
The Organisational Needs Analysis and associated Learning Plan identifies the agreed outcomes and business impacts agreed with employers. We measure the effectiveness of the training on the employer’s business objectives immediately post-achievement, and then again after an agreed period of time. This feedback loop and self-assessment for improving planning and delivery in future to employers is crucial, following the post-training review.
It will be the responsibility of the project delivery team to collate data on the monitoring metrics and generate quarterly reports for monitoring and evaluation review meetings incorporating local economic updates and data from the quarterly economic surveys.  
Starts vs. Achievements and Learner Retention. This is a key indicator and is directly relevant to the success of our provision. These are monitored on a weekly basis, with future achievement rates projected through our ProTarget application. This enables us to quickly identify any potential areas of concern to take remedial action if required in a timely fashion. This is important due to the correlation between apprentice achievement rates and employer satisfaction and impact. We also monitor retention by sector and qualification to ensure individual apprentices are satisfied, and to incorporate feedback from leavers to improve programmes. 
Learner Destinations. Progression KPIs are established at the beginning of the programme (whether in work, career progression or further qualifications) to ensure that our programmes are having a clear impact. We monitor this intelligence to inform the quality of both our curriculum delivery and the business consultancy we offer to employers at the beginning of the programme.
Future Numbers (Pipeline) and Forecasts. Our future numbers are monitored through a Business Development Pipeline. We build a detailed profile of planned sectors, frameworks and standards for the year, and build capacity accordingly. Monitoring our future pipeline and forecasts ensures that we balance this capacity with employer demand and keeps us on track to service those sectors and employers where we have identified demand through our various Labour Market Intelligence studies. Additionally, monitoring these KPIs ensures that capacity can be increased accordingly should there be additional demand in a particular area in-year.
Number of Students. Connected to the above, the number of students benefitting from our Apprenticeship programmes is monitored to ensure that our capacity and capability is adequate to meet employer demand at any time. 
Destination. Achievement gaps are reduced in several ways. First, by ensuring that students with particular needs receive appropriate information and guidance in order to fully determine additional support needs from the outset. Management data is produced monthly to compare performance (e.g. recruitment, retention, achievement, progression) of learners against targets to determine achievement gaps and deliver actions to reduce these. 
Desired progression (whether into work, career progression or further study) is agreed at the programme start, with a clear roadmap to further qualifications.




7. Management & Control7.1 Please describe whether or not the necessary team is in place to carry out the proposed activity in Greater Lincolnshire and if not what the plans are to recruit the relevant expertise? Please insert structure chart, if available.
Lincoln College has extensive experience of carrying out projects which require new build, refurbishment, purchasing of equipment and the reshaping of education and training. We have allocated staff to the project team and where necessary have held back on some appointments pending notification of further funding. 

Key points regarding the team are as follows:
* Proven track record: We will draw on our proven reputation of delivering high profile infrastructure and education projects and programmes both nationally and internationally. The project will include staff with experience of substantial new build programmes, as well as projects to transform existing parts of our estate. Our experience includes:
o Since 2016, opening five new micro-college campuses, in 2016 the Construction College in Gainsborough and the Air and Defence Career College in Lincoln and in 2019 the Lincoln Construction College, Care College and Policing College.  These offer employer-led, career focused education and technical training for 16 -19 year olds. 
o Since 2016 LCG mobilised five new further education colleges in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as part of the Colleges of Excellence programme,  providing teaching space for over 10,000 students.
o Newark Academy, we led the construction and relocation of the Academy to a brand new £15.5 million school as part of the Priority School Building Programme in 2015/16. 
o Deans Sport and Leisure, 2012/13 we opened one of the best sport facilities in Lincoln, offering fitness suites, squash and tennis courts, a spa and floodlit all weather pitches, as well an internet cafe, juice bar and many corporate facilities, such as conference and meeting rooms. 
o Made in Gainsborough, development of a bespoke Engineering training centre in conjunction with local employers.
* Strong project management experience: We have experience of operating collaboratively with multiple partners, and have extensive programme resources, knowledge, expertise and skills to deliver the project and mitigate associated risks. A project delivery plan is in place, with progress regularly monitored by our Group lead for projects using Prince 2 and Managing Successful Programmes (MSP) approaches.
* Project team: We will deploy a team of in-house expertise and externally sourced advisors to ensure the best mix of resources.
o Jacqui Varlow, Group Head of HR and Student Support Services will lead the project. 
o She will be responsible for implementing the project delivery plan. This will include key milestones, monitoring/reporting requirements, financial controls and a risk register. 
o She will report on progress direct to the College Executive Leadership Team on a monthly basis. 
o She will lead a multi-disciplinary project delivery team including the Group Head of Infrastructure, Facilities and Estates, and Group Director of Finance and Commercial, Group Director of IT, Information Management and executive lead for projects, Director of Performance and Planning, and Tom Marsden who has executive responsibility for strategic growth.
o This project team will be supported by other College business support teams as appropriate. Any additional recruitment needs that may be required as the project progresses will be managed quickly and effectively by Lincoln College Group's in-house agency, FE Resources.

Delivery Team
A  delivery team will be recruited, to consist of a Practice Manager, Administrators, Fitness Coach and Trainers to be supported by LPFT staff.

Equipment sourcing:
We will source any equipment purchases responsibly. Lincoln College will ensure that it follows the GLLEP's procurement requirements when selecting goods and services funded by the LEP. The College follows public sector procurement guidelines and has a procurement policy in place that details the regulations, responsibilities and accountabilities for the procurement of goods, services and works.






7.2 State Aid:  The Greater Lincolnshire LEP and its accountable body are required to ensure that funding complies with the rules on state aid. State aid is any advantage granted by public authorities through state resources on a selective basis to any organisations that could potentially distort competition and trade in the European Union (EU). If your project proposal constitutes state aid we will be unable to fund it unless you can demonstrate that it is outside the scope of or exempt from state aid rules. If you believe this to be the case please provide an explanation below. 
Lincoln College is a Further Education College which became incorporated under the 1992 Act of Parliament. The College has charitable status and its prime function is the provision of further and higher education.
State aid involves using funding from a public body to provide support in a commercial enterprise that might distort competition and affect trade in the EU. EU rules contain a number of exemptions which allow public bodies to intervene in the economy and to offer funding to address market failure. These exemptions allow public bodies to provide funding for a number of areas including education and initial pre-employment training and certain training aid with conditions around employer co-funding.
 
We consider that funding from the LEP for this project would not constitute state aid under EU regulations as the majority of the college’s activities fall under these exemptions.
