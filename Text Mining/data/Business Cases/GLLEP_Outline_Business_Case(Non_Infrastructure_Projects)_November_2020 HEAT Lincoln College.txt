Project Summary
(Please keep as  brief as possible as this will be used for publicity purposes and uploaded onto the GL LEP website)(i) Economic Impact

Capital funding will enable the UK's first Hospitality, Events, Arts and Tourism (HEAT) College to be developed in Greater Lincolnshire. 
The project will provide an employer-led training facility designed to offer critical support to one of the GLLEP’s Priority Sectors, the Visitor Economy, at a time when it is needed the most.
Over the past 12 months, the tourism and hospitality industries have faced unprecedented challenges, with significantly decreased demand and many local businesses closing temporarily.
HEAT will offer active support to local businesses via a range of training services that will help the sector to grow, develop and innovate by upskilling the workforce. 
The new development will offer a total of approximately 5,000 sq ft of educational floor space which will include the provision of a C-hotel (College Hotel), which will offer learning in a live environment.
Working in partnership with the University of Westminster and educational institutions in Denmark, the USA and the Middle East, along with Lincolnshire based employers such as the Intercontinental Hotel Group, the Hilton Worldwide Group, the Stonegate Pub Company and Butlins, the project will provide a state-of-the-art learning environment, with cutting edge technologies focused on plugging skills gaps and delivering training in the application of digital assistive technologies. Having consulted with local employers and industry bodies such as Visit Lincoln, we will increase the number and range of new apprenticeships offered and launch T-Levels in Hospitality and Tourism, Cultural Heritage and Visitor Attractions, and Catering. 

Students will also benefit from the opportunity to work in the theatre and events sector at the Drill Hall, the arts sector via our partnerships with local galleries and the catering and events sector via Lincoln College's own commercial catering business. The majority of the placements on offer through the College or our partners will be paid, enabling students to earn-while-they-learn. 

In addition to supporting established employers, the HEAT Institute will offer advice, guidance and support for those individuals who would like to open their own hospitality business via an Entrepreneurship Scheme in partnership with NBV Enterprise, leading to empty spaces in the city becoming repurposed.

The project will deliver economic impact at all levels:
* Providing individuals with access to qualifications that have previously never been delivered in Greater Lincolnshire, including the cross cutting digital skills that will support growth and innovation.
* Offer a routeway to new employment opportunities.
* Support the post-Covid demands of the industry and the pace of tourism development within Greater Lincolnshire.
* Strengthen institutional capability and human resources in the tourism  industry and increase employment opportunities.
* Support the new era of tourism and cultural changes that are required in a post-pandemic world.
* Support the sector to adopt digital technologies and platforms which will enable them to improve productivity and attract more visitors.
* Provide accessibility, inclusivity and support social mobility and reducing the transitory nature of the industry's workforce and demonstrate career possibilities.
* Re-imagine, accelerate and upgrade vocational education in the region.
* Deliver via a blended model - mix of digital and face to face, live learning, work experience placements and industry visits.
* Supporting local businesses across all sectors to fill their ‘hard to fill vacancies’ and succession plan for the future.
* Creating bespoke employment routeways that will provide job-ready candidates to local businesses.
Within the first two years of delivery, the new facility is expected to engage over 250 local businesses in skills training, have created at least 50 new apprentices, supported 50 learners into new jobs and supported the creation of 20 new businesses.

i) How will the project deliver training and fill skills gaps to meet employer needs within the LEP priority sectors?

The Hospitality, Events, Arts and Tourism (HEAT) College will offer the very best in practical and academic training to fill the GLLEP skills gaps and training needs in the Visitor Economy sector.
Employer Consultation 
Engaging and consulting with employers is an important part of the Lincoln College Group (LCG) approach to curriculum design and as a result we make regular changes to ensure the relevance of the qualifications and training offered. In addition to employers stipulating the training and skills that they require both now and, in the future, we are also proactive in our use of Labour Market Intelligence (LMI) reports and software such as Vector, that highlight broader needs.
We regularly consult with our network of over 1,000 employers via 1-2-1 meetings, focus groups, representative federations and electronic surveys. Lincoln College has a strong relationship with Visit Lincoln and we will use our curriculum to support the local Visitor Economy strategy. Indirectly, increasing the quality of the hospitality offer will have an impact on visitor spend across the region.
The HEAT College will have a central learning hub in Lincoln and will be supported by either permanent or pop-up spokes across the county of Lincolnshire. In addition to the physical locations, the College will use digital technology to deliver remotely, enabling students to access learning at home or at work and giving them the flexibility to study at a time that suits them. This technology will also allow the College to use the senior education expertise that exists in Lincoln College International and provide access to contributions from partners based outside of the region.
Working with partners and using existing College facilities it will offer core hospitality and tourism focussed education provision for 16-18 year old learners alongside additional provision for adults, comprising commercial courses, CPD courses, Sector Based Work Academies and learning funded by the Adult Education Budget that will enhance the learners’ job-readiness.

New Apprenticeship Standards and T-Levels
Apprenticeships and Traineeships will continue to be offered and are likely to be more important than ever as part of the government’s Covid-19 recovery plan. 
Employers have told us that skills training is an important issue in the sector and that they are keen to improve the quality of training available to their teams, with a view to retaining them within the sector in the long-term.
Therefore, all of the courses and qualifications will offer a line of sight to work or a pathway to Higher Education, particularly in sector-specific leadership and management.
Training will also provide an increase in the participant’s knowledge of the local area and attractions in order to offer an improved visitor experience and an opportunity to up/cross-sell.
T-Levels in Hospitality and Tourism, Catering, and Cultural Heritage and Visitor Attractions will be offered for the first time. These qualifications are brought to life by practical work placements of four months, enabling students to practice skills learnt. HEAT students would benefit from the following opportunities:
Chef, catering and front of house skills as part of HEAT’s restaurant and commercial catering business.
Hotel roles in the C-hotel and via our partner organisations.
Events management through the HEAT College events business and experience as part of the Drill Hall team.
Arts roles via our partner galleries and also at the Drill Hall.
Employers across the region also highlighted a need for digital skills training. The requests ranged from supporting staff with basic office skills to being able to protect an organisation’s data and IP from cyber-attack. Local businesses want to ensure that they have the skilled and capable workforce needed in an increasingly digital world, as a lack of digital skills is a common barrier to people fulfilling their potential and to organisations enjoying increased productivity and growth.
They specifically requested marketing, social media and digital marketing skills, that would enable upselling of accommodation and local attractions, potentially increase the length of the visitor’s stay, and enable them to experience the unique selling points of their business via augmented and virtual reality. Such materials would also allow them to use social influencers to broaden awareness of their offer.

1. Deliverability1.1 What is the Project? 
(Please summarise in 100 words or less.  More specific details can be provided in other sections of the form)HEAT provides an innovative live-learning experience which responds directly to the Visitor Economy’s training and labour market needs and the significant challenges caused by Covid-19. With inclusivity at its heart, this employer-led project will fill gaps in this GLLEP priority sector through the provision of an exclusive, student-run hotel/College in the heart of Lincoln. The project will address the lack of investment in skills and sector specific training programmes, low productivity and the need to increase digitisation of the customer experience, thereby improving the sector’s productivity and earnings, by offering blended learning and brand new apprenticeship and T-Level qualifications.
1.2 How will the project be delivered, to and by whom? 
Briefly explain: 
* The specific activities that will be undertaken as part of the project 
* Who are the target beneficiaries? 
* Where the project’s activity will take place Where the activity will take place

The purchase of the Judges Lodgings building in Lincoln will provide the site for the Hospitality, Events, Arts and Tourism College. It will function as a hotel for paying guests thereby offering a live learning environment for students and incorporate classrooms equipped with cutting-edge technology.

The following pictures depict how the hotel might look:


 


 

 



In addition to the HEAT College hub in Lincoln, training delivery will be supported by either permanent or pop-up spokes across the county of Greater Lincolnshire. As well as the physical locations, the College will use digital technology to deliver remotely, enabling students to access learning at home or at work and giving them the flexibility to study at a time that suits them. This technology will also allow the College to use the senior education expertise that exists in Lincoln College International and provide access to contributions from partners based outside of the region.

Working with partners and using existing College facilities it will offer core hospitality and tourism focussed education provision for 16-18 year old learners alongside additional provision for adults, comprising commercial courses, CPD courses, Sector Based Work Academies and learning funded by the Adult Education Budget that will enhance the learners’ job-readiness.

Beneficiaries

The target beneficiaries include:

* Businesses in the Visitor Economy sector.
* Sector employers throughout Greater Lincolnshire who have not accessed training provision to support workforce development, those with hard to fill vacancies, and those with digital skills needs to promote and sustain growth. 
* Individuals who have either lost employment, are at risk of redundancy or are looking for a career change due to the effects of the pandemic.
* Long-term unemployed.
* Young people aged 14-19 who want to work in the hospitality, events, arts or tourism sector, and are considering an Apprenticeship. 
* Those looking to start their own business in this sector.
* School children – engagement and raising awareness of the opportunities within the Visitor Economy sector through tasters and open days.

Activities that will be undertaken

The overarching concept of the HEAT College brings together several curriculum areas with a shared vision – that of offering highly productive, skilled, practical learning through classroom-based education delivered in a blended way. Digitally led and incorporating remote-learning, mobile-learning and the opportunity to learn in live environments, there will be an intense focus on applied learning and employability.

The project will focus on the LEP priority Visitor Economy sector and help to overcome well-documented skills gaps and shortages and support the region’s businesses emerge successfully from the pandemic and associated challenges that closure and loss of business have caused.

Specifically, HEAT College will deliver:

* New learning programmes at Entry Level to Level 5. 
* 25 new apprentices per year studying new Standards, such as Hospitality Supervisor, Hospitality Manager, Conference and Events Organisation, Housekeeping, Concierge and Guest Services, Alcoholic Beverage Service and Chef de Partie.
* New delivery methods using instructor led training (ILT) providing direct skills provision to local companies. 
* Remote delivery, leading to 500 additional supported learning places over 5 years.
* Direct support to local hospitality businesses to help digitise their working practices. 
* Continuous professional development for HEAT staff through collaboration with industry professionals.

HEAT College will train high quality, industry specialists with sector-specific situational and cultural awareness. It will also train Visitor Economy sector staff in the application and development of digital technologies, especially those focused on marketing and communication to streamline processes, enhance customer contact, grow revenue, transform behaviours and develop solution architecture. 

The College will operate a live hotel that allows learners to immerse themselves in their chosen environment and gain experience that would be unavailable elsewhere. In addition, students will have the opportunity to work as a paid employee in our commercial catering business, on the proposed College campsite located just outside of Lincoln, and experience the challenges of events management as part of the Drill Hall team.

Our approach to the project will focus on introducing mobile learning, distance learning, online learning platforms and virtual, augmented and mixed reality technologies. Specially designed modules and support for mobile access to online learning platforms 4G and 5G technology will deliver highly visual and interactive skills refreshers in the workplace during a tea break or pre/post shift. 

We will provide learners with access to their course online 24/7 and they will be able to participate in remote lectures. 


2. Project Need2.1 Why is the project needed in Greater Lincolnshire?

We have spent considerable time engaging and consulting with local employers, Lincolnshire County Council, local authorities, industry bodies and other stakeholders to design a project which responds to the needs of Greater Lincolnshire.

1. It responds to employers’ skill gaps and LEP priorities:

The project provides direct support to address skill shortages for a key GLLEP priority sector, namely the Visitor Economy.  

In 2018 Greater Lincolnshire welcomed over 21 million visitors per year which generated around £2.39bn revenue for the region. Prior to the pandemic the sector was growing quickly, by over 13% in the previous two years, which in turn created jobs and national prestige. 

Tourism in Greater Lincolnshire has a lot of strengths:

* Renowned heritage attractions including the Castle, Cathedral and Magna Carta in Lincoln, Belton House and the International Bomber Command Centre.
* Over 50 miles of coastline.
* Skegness – Britain’s fourth most popular holiday resort.
* A strong nature/wildlife tourism offer.
* Aviation Heritage.
* Enhanced connectivity by road and rail.
* 110 hotels in the region with capacity for more than 3.4m overnight stays.

However, according to industry bodies, the advent of Covid-19 led to 89% of businesses in the sector closing completely and 11% operating on a reduced basis, mainly offering takeaway services. Naturally, this had a significant impact on the 39,000 staff employed in the sector across Lincolnshire, with more than 80% of them being furloughed, resulting in many experienced employees leaving the sector altogether and working in alternative sectors such as retail or health and care. 

The complexity of the recruitment and training challenge faced by the sector is enhanced following the UK’s departure from the EU, as many sector workers are expected to have returned to mainland Europe. Therefore, there is an urgent need to improve the training offer in the sector, in order to retain the remaining staff and attract high quality new employees.

The preference of the hospitality businesses that we have engaged with is to have a pool of suitable people from which to recruit, who have already participated in a Sector and Employment Routeway that was created and delivered to cover their training needs. Given that the number of Greater Lincolnshire’s jobseekers aged 18-24 has increased fourfold since April 2020, the priority has to be to support young people to access Further Education, such as HEAT College programmes, and then progress to higher levels of qualifications either in the workplace via apprenticeships and work-based learning or through Higher Education Institutes. 

HEAT College will support that need by delivering first class provision that will develop the skills base of the sector through enhanced IAG, apprenticeships and classroom based training. The opportunity to learn and work in live environments such as the C-hotel, Drill Hall and commercial catering business will attract a better quality of student and ensure that they have relevant sector experience prior to employment. Given that the majority of local tourism businesses are either categorised as SME or Micro with limited in-house training capacity, being able to employ someone who has been trained to a high standard and has hours of experience of working in a similar environment is a significant advantage and will increase productivity immediately.

Lincoln College have undertaken extensive consultation with a range of employers and key stakeholders in order to fully understand their requirements. 

This has taken the form of: 
* Focus groups.
* Roundtable and 1:1 discussions.
* Attendance at sector-focused workforce groups.
* Consultation with representative bodies. 
* Distribution of a questionnaire.

Employers consulted include:




Supports the sector to respond to Covid-19

After months of economic uncertainty, there is little doubt that the pandemic has had a crippling effect on businesses up and down the country. The impact of the pandemic has affected organisations from nearly every sector, but certain industries have been affected more than others. One of those business sectors severely impacted by the lockdown and which has felt the full impact of Covid-19 is the hospitality industry.

As the third largest sector for employment in the UK (3.2m workers) the hospitality industry itself is larger than the automotive, pharmaceutical, and aerospace industries combined. This statistic shows how pivotal the sector is to the local economy and why it cannot be allowed to fail.

Government restrictions and periods of lockdown have had a crushing effect on the tourism and hospitality sector, with 89% of businesses being forced to close their doors at some points during the past 12 months and with more than 80% of staff furloughed. 

This unprecedented situation led the Chief Executive of trade body UK Hospitality to publicly state that ‘the decline we (the hospitality sector) are seeing in other sectors, alarming although they may be, are incidental compared to the truly alarming hit that ours is taking’.

HEAT College will put the Visitor Economy at the forefront of young people’s minds as a career option and the opportunity of paid work experience whilst learning will be an attractive proposition. Businesses will be able to engage with learners on both long and short study programmes, either on work experience as part of their course or as a member of the HEAT College recruitment agency, providing a pipeline of motivated, enthusiastic employees on a flexible basis.

Although used to dealing with economic and seasonal fluctuations, our region’s tourism businesses need urgent and ongoing support to be able to regain confidence and rebuild on a sustainable basis.
HEAT College will provide CPD training to ensure:

* Customer service standards are improved and that changes to customer behaviours and expectations caused by the pandemic are understood and met. 
* Businesses understand how to incorporate affordable digital technology to respond to improve the customer experience.
* Reviews of business continuity and growth strategies, financial forecasting and future planning are part of business as usual.
* The creation and regular review of investment plans (cash and capital investment) to determine ROI.
* Managers understand options re staffing structures and how best to retain, retrain and offer flexibility to the business and the individual.
* Marketing strategies are in place to maximise occupancy rates of rooms and tables.
* Digital channels are used to keep visitors engaged and use leads effectively.


2.2 What research or evidence has been undertaken to demonstrate the need, demand or impact of this project?  Please attach or provide links to completed studies and impact assessments where available.
The College has engaged extensively with employers and stakeholder groups representing the identified priority sectors in and around Lincoln. We conducted our research via:

* Focus groups.
* Roundtable discussions.
* 1-2-1 conversations.
* Attendance at employer workforce groups.
* Consultation with representative bodies and public sector departments.
* Desk based research.

We were keen to understand which of their vacancies employers find hardest to fill, current and future recruitment needs and the type of support that would help them grow their business.

It was clear from speaking to the businesses that one of the biggest challenges is the diverse nature of the Visitor Economy sector, comprising hotels and other accommodation, restaurants and takeaways, bars and leisure services. It is also dominated by small establishments, many of which compete for customers and staff and is quite a volatile sector where staff move frequently. As a result, industry bodies and employers called for a level of stability and consistency within the industry. They wanted to be able to recruit staff who had been trained to a defined standard and to have access to continuous professional development training that would improve the quality and productivity of the business and provide staff members with a sense of value and of embarking on a career.

Most establishments reported that local advertising in the press, jobsites or Jobcentres was generally unproductive and that they were more likely to use word of mouth or internal promotion. This often proves to be inefficient though as speed to fill rates vary dramatically and internal promotions leave the issue of back-filling the other role. Use of temporary agency staff is avoided due to the ‘damage that they can cause’ and the significant variance in training, skills and experience of the individuals. For most external vacancies, employers reported a shortage of people ‘with the right attitude’ coming forward rather than skills shortages as such. However, in addition to a strong work ethic and capacity for sustained hard work, ‘the right attitude’ in these contexts involves the possession of, or potential to develop, ‘soft skills’ which are absolutely crucial to high performance hospitality - most significantly, interpersonal skills and team-working skills. HEAT College will provide a solution to all of these issues:

* Offering a pipeline of candidates for both full-time and part-time roles.
* Ensuring that candidates have relevant experience in the live learning environments.
* Support with succession planning and the opportunity to plan recruitment of students.
* Ensuring that all students are motivated, engaged and enthusiastic, and trained in soft skills.


The most critical reported skill gaps were associated with managerial skills, mainly ‘people’ and financial skills at departmental and supervisory level, and the technical skills now required of chefs - such as cost control, stock management and record keeping. Hospitality has a low proportion of qualified managers relative to other sectors. HEAT College will offer higher level Hospitality Manager and Hospitality Supervisor apprenticeships to meet this need.

Skills required by employers were grouped into three categories: industry-specific or vocational skills (mainly technical skills such as food production and preparation, stock management, cost control); generic skills (e.g. managerial skills, particularly small business management, communication, problem-solving, selling skills, literacy and foreign language competence) and competence deriving from attitude to work (e.g. enthusiasm, commitment, the will to learn). While nearly all employers reported a willingness to train staff in most technical skills and, to an increasing extent, in generic skills, it was the third category which they found the most critical in terms of recruitment, hardest to address, and which they were most likely to see as a problem outside their remit and beyond their means to remedy. HEAT College is especially well placed to resolve this issue through Sector Based Work Academies which will provide a pipeline of job-ready candidates to employers.

An area of development that was mentioned frequently was that of digital skills. It is clear that most hospitality businesses feel as though they have failed to keep pace with technological developments and as a result, skills in this area are poor. This is not uncommon generally, with the region’s own Digital Landscape Report 2017 reporting that 31% of employers have skills gaps in basic computer literacy and 32% reported gaps in advanced IT software skills. However, businesses see accessing and harnessing digital skills as being crucial to their success in bouncing back strongly from the impact of the pandemic and enabling them to attract and retain repeat business. They are keen to use social media and digital marketing as a way to reach new customer groups and improve the customer experience, by simplifying the booking process, enabling automated check-ins, offering more channels of communication, upsell products and services and offer augmented and virtual reality tours. 

The focus on digital training will also enable sector employees to access learning materials and content remotely via smartphones and other digital devices. This will allow students to dip in and out of learning during their break or lunchtimes, or on public transport.  Such innovations will mean that all of Greater Lincolnshire can benefit from the CPD training offered by HEAT College, overcoming issues around rurality and transport constraints and access to learning can occur on a variety of devices.  

Businesses were also interested in obtaining specialist training that would allow them to provide additional facilities and services to cater for groups with special needs and disabilities.

Much of the employers’ views are echoed by the Greater Lincolnshire Tourism Action Plan 2021-2030 which recognises that whilst Greater Lincolnshire has a lot of strengths already referenced in this tender, there are also significant weaknesses, some of which HEAT College would be able to address:

* Lack of investment in skills and sector specific training programmes.
* Low productivity. 
* Lack of digital skills training.
* Recruitment challenges following the UK’s departure from the EU.
* Challenges in responding to the impact of Covid-19.

HEAT College would provide a response to all of these issues:

* The UK’s first Hospitality, Events, Arts and Tourism College will offer a range of sector specific training programmes and long and short courses available. The majority of courses would be free to the learner. 
* Offering a pipeline of job-ready candidates to businesses either on a permanent or temporary basis through our HEAT College recruitment agency, would help increase productivity levels throughout the sector’s businesses. Support with succession planning would be available and establishments would be able to work with future candidates through work placements, allowing both parties to determine whether they fit with the organisation.
* Digital skills modules would be provided to students and CPD and apprentices would be available to local businesses to improve that part of their business.
* HEAT College will offer a pipeline of job-ready, experienced candidates to local businesses.
* HEAT College will play an integral part in helping the region’s businesses bounce back and longer term recovery from Covid-19.
2.3 Please explain how the project will deliver the strategic objectives of the Local Enterprise Partnership area and will demonstrate alignment with other local growth priorities.  Please include how you will deliver against the Local Industrial Strategy and the  Covid Recovery Plan
How will the project support the key principles of sustainable development – including Equality and Diversity assessments?  Will the scheme provide Net Zero Carbon solutions as part of its delivery?
Will it support the government's Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial RevolutionThe project is designed to focus on meeting the needs of Greater Lincolnshire through providing training and skills development to a priority sector, Visitor Economy, at a time when it needs it the most. The project will support the sector as follows:

* Early return on investment: HEAT College is a solution that delivers strong value for money and a quick return on investment. The Visitor Economy is a priority sector for Greater Lincolnshire LEP and the professional training courses on offer will deliver significant impact from September 2022, with fully qualified apprentices being part of the Greater Lincolnshire workforce by 2023.
* Equality of provision: The project will enhance hospitality and tourism skills development across the whole of Greater Lincolnshire, thereby addressing issues associated with rurality and equality of access to training and skills development. The DofE Area Review (Final Report August 2017) identified that FE provision must respond to the needs of individuals and employers, with provision to be accessible to all. The project will address the steering group desire for remote and e-learning technologies to help address equality of access to provision. 
* Direct response to employers’ needs: The project responds to gaps in training and skills provision highlighted by employers (through research, interviews and focus groups) and by the Greater Lincolnshire Tourism Action Plan. In response to this feedback, we will deliver vocational short and long courses from Level 2 through to Level 5. These solutions are critical conditions for growth and will address issues associated with rural accessibility to skills development solutions. 
* Producing career ready employees: HEAT College will enable Greater Lincolnshire employers in the Visitor Economy sector to maximise the potential of their existing workforce via 'candidates-in-place' apprenticeship training and professional courses. In addition, the college will also grow a new 21st Century generation of digitally aware, career-ready employees, infused with cultural, technical and tactical sectoral skills.
* Business start-up support: Through our partnership with NBV, the facility will provide support to help businesses grow and prosper as well as helping nurture the ideas of start-ups. These characteristics will stimulate added economic and social value across Greater Lincolnshire by enabling firms to future-proof their growth strategies, succession plan and provide a platform for organisational development. 
* Enhanced information, advice and guidance: The project will support the development of the skills base of the Visitor Economy sector through enhanced information, advice and guidance, new qualifications and apprenticeships standards, and mentoring and support for business start-ups.
LIS Priorities
* Productivity growth: The project will directly drive up productivity through highly trained apprenticeships and HEAT College graduates that closely match industry requirements. Research shows that firms employing apprentices will benefit from increased long-term productivity. A typical apprentice delivers productivity gains of over £10,000 per annum. Even before an apprentice is fully qualified, many businesses will see economic benefits of offering apprenticeships. Figures show that while training, each apprentice in England is estimated to deliver an average positive net gain of £1,670 per annum to their employers. (Economic impact 2015 UK GOV commissioned study).
The project will also focus on meeting the priorities of the LIS, focusing on the five foundations of productivity:
Ideas  
* Encouraging businesses to think differently and respond to challenges in a solution focused way. Through the sharing of best practice and sector focus events, we will encourage establishments to share experiences and develop new ideas together.
People  
* HEAT College will support the enabling of residents to achieve potential in the local labour market and participate in the inclusive economy.
* The working age population is shrinking, and HEAT will support the upskilling and retraining of the existing workforce.
* The economy is seeing the demand for Level 2 qualifications and above rise, and replacement demand ensures that there continues to be a large number of vacancies for people with Level 1 to 3. HEAT College will meet this demand.
* Develop Visitor Economy focused work academies to provide pathways into employment for residents.
* Equip the workforce with high quality relevant training.
* Help businesses adapt and compete with other regions, securing more new and repeat customers.
Infrastructure
* Provide the region with the training that the Visitor Economy sector requires to support businesses, connect people and be prepared for future growth and challenges.
* Attempt to overcome the challenges provided by the large geography and dispersed population of the region by increasing connectivity via access to courses through digital technology platforms.
* Providing businesses with the digital skills they require to grow and innovate.
Business environment 
* HEAT College will support the large number of small and micro businesses in the Visitor Economy sector to recover from the pandemic and access skills training that has never been available previously.
* Create a supportive business environment for entrepreneurs and SMEs – to grow and become more productive and resilient.
* Support businesses to increase productivity through the use of technology, succession planning, pipelines of job-ready candidates for temporary and permanent positions.
Place
* HEAT College will facilitate recruitment and access to training in the Visitor Economy.
* Inclusion challenge – vital to find solutions in terms of inclusive growth and increase in the prosperity of areas.
Covid Recovery Plan
* Workforce: HEAT College will deliver bespoke programmes which will help employers to provide good quality jobs for young people. Since April 2020, the number of benefit claimants in Greater Lincolnshire aged between 16 – 24 has quadrupled and HEAT College will offer a modern, exciting place to learn and a career pathway into the Visitor Economy sector. T-Levels linked to the hospitality sector will be available for the first time in the region at HEAT College.
* Workforce: HEAT College will improve the region’s training infrastructure, offering a broad range of hospitality, events and tourism courses. Learners will have the opportunity to put their skills into practice by means of paid work experience in one of the college’s live learning environments at the C-hotel, Drill Hall or catering functions. 
* Workforce: HEAT College will offer a variety of CPD courses to the sector’s existing employees, giving them an unprecedented chance to enhance their skills and progress within the sector. Courses will be of high-quality and delivered in a blended fashion, providing access right across the region. Employers will be consulted on a regular basis and be given the opportunity to amend the curriculum to ensure relevance.
* Drive investment, skills and growth: the designation of Greater Lincolnshire as a Tourism Action Zone will bring a new focus to the region and HEAT College will be employer-led and drive the skills agenda.
* Business Support: as an employer-led college, HEAT College will introduce training programmes for local businesses to help them understand what they can do to adapt to market changes, customer priorities and continue to trade and to grow.
Supporting sustainable development: The project will support the key principles of sustainable development by providing opportunities to allow everyone to fulfil their potential. It will provide employers with the skills they demand and require - now and in the future. Throughout the project we will:
* Carry out Equality and Diversity assessments.
* Promote equality and diversity.
* Monitor the use of resources
* Provide accessible training and skills provision.
* Meet the needs and aspirations of young people and the community. 
* Ensure that best practice is disseminated as widely as possible.
Sustainable Tourism: the project will teach that economic, social and environmental impacts are considered together and that a long-term view is taken to business development in the sector.




3. Project Timeline and Milestones
Please outline the key steps that have been, or will be, completed to ensure delivery of the project Lincoln College has been developing the concept of this project for over one year. As a result, we have already achieved important steps and milestones which provide high confidence that the project will deliver on time and to quality standards. Points of note include:

* Identification of skills gap: In conjunction with stakeholders such as Visit Lincoln and Lincolnshire County Council, the College identified a need to enhance the region’s hospitality skills offer in 2018. We explored this concept further and discussed the sector’s requirements further with regional employers and local authorities. The message was consistent, that the region needed improved training provision to increase the quality of the visitor and customer experience in all manner of businesses. The HEAT College concept was born and shared with stakeholders in late 2019. The pandemic has only strengthened the view of partners, stakeholders and employers that such provision is necessary; now more than ever.
* Initial design: Several sites have been reviewed as the HEAT College hub and general plans have been drawn up for a C-hotel (College hotel) of six individually sponsored bedrooms and a small restaurant and conference facility. The College is also exploring the opportunity to purchase a small staycation venue just outside of Lincoln that would be included as part of the HEAT experience and is working on a proposal to re-open the Drill Hall in Lincoln city centre.
* Project mobilisation: We have put in place the necessary steps to ensure rapid project mobilisation if successful with a future bid. Lincoln College has previously signed a SCAPE Access agreement with Perfect Circle under the Built Environment Consultancy Services (BECS) framework. Key points: 
o The Scape Group is a public-sector owned organisation, dedicated to creating ongoing efficiency and social value via the built environment. 
o Perfect Circle have been appointed by Scape Procure to lead the national BECS framework and they will support every stage of the construction project. 
o They will lead the procurement process led by the Public Contract Regulations. 
o This offers the fastest route to market, will ensure full compliance with all public procurement regulations, offers complete auditability of project data and performance, and will create significant opportunities for local suppliers and tradesmen, as on average 35% of the total spend is distributed within 20 miles.
o Using Scape, the procurement process will take between six and eight weeks.
o The contractor will use Lincoln College construction students to support the refurbishment work.
* Early outcomes: Although the building would not be available for use for the nine months it will take to refurbish, the project will still be able to deliver outcomes from as early as July 2021 through HEAT College partnerships at the Drill Hall in Lincoln and the via the commercial catering business run by Lincoln College.

4. Options Analysis4.1 Why should the project receive LEP funding?Why should we benefit from LEP funding?

Project aligns with the GLLEP Strategic Economic Plan, the LIS and the Greater Lincolnshire Tourism Action Plan

HEAT College is of strategic importance to GLLEP and will provide Greater Lincolnshire wide skills solutions to support greater economic growth and competitiveness in the Visitor Economy sector.

* It supports business productivity and economic growth via the delivery of new apprenticeships and T-Level qualifications, by offering blended CPD. 
* HEAT College will provide a state-of-the-art live learning environment delivering training that develops a talent pipeline that provides employers with a pool of skilled people to meet skills gaps and growth potential. 
* It will support businesses to respond positively to the challenges faced in a Covid-19 world.
* It provides the skills investment that the Greater Lincolnshire Tourism Action Plan requests.

Value for Money

* HEAT College will deliver outcomes from September 2022 providing a prompt return on investment and measurable impact across the priority sector that it supports. It will encourage and support local businesses to transform and innovate, grow revenue, operate more efficiently and develop capability.
* The project is low risk- Lincoln College are an established organisation with expertise and a proven track record of delivering high profile capital projects.


Employer led

* The Lincoln College mission statement is to be ‘Employer led; producing a highly skilled and productive local workforce.” 
* We have undertaken extensive consultation over the past 12 months in the development of this project. HEAT College is a direct response to employers’ needs and industry body recommendations and addresses the gaps which they have highlighted in both recruitment and the delivery of skills training. 

Inclusivity of bid

* HEAT College will offer region wide support to the Visitor Economy sector.
* It will support sector employees to achieve their career aspirations and enable young people to access the industry as a skilled staff member.
* The bid will offer the same support to international hospitality companies and SME and Micro businesses alike.


4.2 What other funding or delivery mechanisms have been considered to deliver the proposed activity?Potential funding opportunities are limited for a project of this scale and without additional funding this project would be unable to proceed. 

4.3 Additionality: What will the project deliver above and beyond what would happen anyway?Additionality
HEAT College will: 
* Meet the training needs of local employers: HEAT College will deliver new training courses that meet the needs of hospitality and tourism sector employers, thereby providing a pipeline of job-ready employees and an accessible source of CPD for existing staff.
* Improve the quality of visitor experience: by offering support and training to all employers, HEAT College will raise the level of customer service offered by the region’s Visitor Economy businesses. Training will deliver a consistent message to learners, helping them to understand what is expected and staff will see the sector as offering a career, rather than simply a job, thus engaging and motivating them to deliver as effectively as they can.
* Offer bespoke support to help the sector recover from Covid-19: without HEAT College, training and support for the sector’s businesses will be disjointed and disparate. Having a co-ordinated approach through a sector focused facility will support the creation of a network of establishments, sharing of best practice and a structured programme of support and training.
* Work in partnership with the University of Westminster: we have an agreement in principle to work in partnership with the University who will offer the Access to Higher Education (A2HE) programme for hospitality and tourism. It is a Level 3 qualification which prepares people for entry to a University programme if they do not currently have the recognised qualifications. The benefits of an A2HE are broader than just the curriculum subject knowledge. It also provides individuals with an insight into the skills required for University-level study and to develop the techniques needed to succeed. The University will also offer access to blended provision that isn’t available in the region and is a digitally based experience.
* Provide investment in new resources for academic delivery and employer training to meet the skills needs of employers in the sector.
* Business support for start-ups in the sector - NBV Enterprise Solutions will provide a Business Advisor to run sessions to develop new ideas.
* Deliver a new Apprenticeship and T-Levels offer that is employer led.
* Meets the skills needs highlighted in the Greater Lincolnshire Tourism Action Plan.
4.4 Scalability: What would happen if reduced LEP funding was available?This project provides an opportunity for GLLEP to invest capital in a development that will have a transformational impact and make a significant contribution to the achievement of the GLLEP priority for growth in a priority sector.

In the instance of reduced LEP funding, the HEAT College project would be unable to take place as proposed, as the purchase and renovation costs of a building would be too much for Lincoln College to bear alone. This would result in the loss of the HEAT College Hub and C-hotel.

Student Impact

Students have regularly requested access to modernised facilities that would lift their learning from the realms of theory into practical experience.

The C-hotel does exactly that, bringing their courses to life by offering the opportunity to ‘do’ rather than just learn. This would improve enrolment numbers to the courses, retention rates, achievement rates and positive destination rates for the students involved.

Employer Impact

Employers have echoed the views of our students and requested more modernised facilities. If the opportunity to gain practical vocational experience was unavailable it would have an adverse effect on recruitment in the industry and reduce the opportunity to undertake sector specific CPD in the region.

Reduced Funding

If a reduced value of funding was made available we would be willing to enter discussions with GLLEP to determine best value for money, despite the significant risks to the feasibility of the project. The property purchase to create the HEAT College Hub and C-hotel is fundamental to the project.

* Quotations for goods and services from suppliers. 
* Analysis of the property market and identification of suitable properties.
* Assessments and professional judgements from externally appointed consultants (including architects, project managers, quantity and building surveyors).
* Assessments and professional judgements from internally appointed experts – Head of Estates Development.
* In-house expertise with extensive experience of managing infrastructure projects. 
* Evaluation against recent investments and via assessment of prices through established procurement consortia and frameworks.

The project delivers a cost per m2 of £4k, commensurate with a high quality education based developments when benchmarked against industry standards.

The College has developed close working relationships with Core Architects and they will support the planning stage to ensure a framework is in place to apply checks and balances ensuring that the cost plan takes into account appropriate quality requirements.

ICT costs have been evaluated against recent investments and via assessment of prices through established procurement consortia and frameworks, and thus are up-to date and accurate.

6.2 Please describe the rationale and assumptions you have made in establishing the outputs and results which will be achieved. This must link clearly to the project’s activity and objectives. Please explain your method for calculating the target levelsLincoln College has extensive experience of budgeting and forecasting performance outputs, with a dedicated team of staff working with our Director of Performance and Planning, who will develop a budget for recruitment, retention and achievement in every curriculum area and across all types of delivery. Their job is to work with departments to develop a budget for recruitment, retention and achievement in every curriculum area and across all types of delivery. Once the budget has been agreed, they will provide Management Information to support the delivery managers track and forecast performance outcomes throughout the year. The Performance and Planning team were consulted extensively in the formulation of the outcome proposals of this project.


Number of learners supported

HEAT College has been designed to provide support to the GLLEP priority sector, Visitor Economy, through the brand new T-Level and apprenticeship delivery and the employer-led curriculum on offer. The college will deliver three new T-Level qualifications and six new apprenticeship standards by 2024.

It is anticipated that the state-of-the-art learning facilities, paid work experience opportunities and increased capacity provided by the project will result in an increase in student numbers in Hospitality and Tourism courses, as well as improved retention and achievement rates. The refurbished HEAT College building will be ready to welcome students from September 2022 and therefore, the increase will be from the 2022/23 academic year.

Also included within the forecast are the number of learners employed by local businesses or participating in the employer initiated pre-employability courses. Local employers have requested CPD and professional qualifications be provided for their own staff, so we plan for one cohort of 24 employees to receive short course support every quarter.

Number of businesses assisted to improve performance

The Lincoln College Group have a history of helping local businesses to improve their performance and the Hospitality, Events, Arts and Tourism College will serve to enhance that offer even further, by helping businesses in the Visitor Economy sector to reduce costs, increase productivity, efficiency, turnover and profit, deliver innovation and plan for growth.

Our mission is to be ‘employer-led; producing a highly skilled and productive local workforce’ and this goal is at the heart of all of our decisions as a college. Everything that we do is with the aim of making local employers more productive and to enhance their performance, whether it’s in producing students with the highest possible academic grades or delivering the best apprenticeship service and results. Our Career Colleges reflect this ethos by working closely with local organisations to ensure that we meet their needs and produce the very best employees for the sector and the HEAT College is based on the same model.

The numbers included in the table above relate to employers who will receive a Skills Needs Analysis, CPD and workforce development either at our HEAT campus, at the workplace or remotely via our digital capability or seek to engage an apprentice from one of the departments supported by the project.

Finally, it also includes the number of nascent businesses who are offered information, advice and guidance by an NBV advisor.

New Jobs Created

This relates to the number of new roles that will be created to support the HEAT College and C-hotel as well as teaching the students.

New Businesses created

This is the number of new businesses that will be created via our partnership with NBV. Our partner, NBV, have significant experience of delivering new business advice all over the country and we have used their performance history and expertise to forecast the number of new businesses that can be expected to be developed in a city centre location.

6.3 Please outline how the project will gather and assess evidence of outputs and results, in line with the LEP's Monitoring and Evaluation Framework 
Lincoln College’s Group Director of IT & Projects will lead the project, he will be responsible for implementing a multi-disciplinary project delivery team ensuring that evidence of outputs and results of agreed monitoring metrics are gathered and assessed in line with the LEP’s monitoring and evaluation framework.
Lincoln College measures a variety of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to monitor and improve performance and assess evidence of outputs; these are recorded on the organisations Top Level Scorecard. 
These measures are interrogated and challenged at various levels, and in various forums. The groups, reviews and processes outlined below are integrated into the improvement cycle, ensuring that the College meets the needs of learners and employers. Regular assessment of success in the above areas allows us to make quick responsive decisions where there are tactical needs. They also allow us to formulate considered and evidence strategies for the future. These include our Employer Engagement Strategy which reflects the local skills needs and LEP priority sector areas, Change Management programmes and staff objectives and appraisals. 
Executive Leadership Team. Key measures are interrogated and discussed monthly by senior managers, based on the scorecard and dashboard.
Quarterly Performance Reviews. A formal review of performance in all relevant areas, led by the Chief Executive, is intended to provide assurance and development in key areas, with agreed actions to make improvements where necessary.  
Managing Directors Reviews. Monthly reviews of performance, led by the MD of Education and Training and attended by the Director of Apprenticeships, Director of Employer Provision and Director of Planning and Performance. 
Monthly Funding Meetings. Focused on important funding and compliance KPIs, provides scrutiny over learner numbers and income performance, and mitigating actions are agreed here where required. College targets are to exceed National averages timely and overall framework achievement by 3%.
Fortnightly Review Meetings. The Head of Apprenticeships & WPL and Training & Skills Leads meet fortnightly to review all data, applications, enrolments, retention and achievements. Any problems are discussed and support is put in place for ‘at risk learners’.  Apprenticeship data and KPIs are reviewed by the Employer Provision management team on a monthly basis.

KPIs form the basis of both the College’s Apprenticeship strategy and operational plan as well as individual performance objectives. The majority of the College’s KPI’s align with the LEP’s monitoring and evaluation framework, however if there is something more specific we would comply and ensure that monitoring is established.  There are several key measures evaluated that cover three important areas: Responsiveness to Employer Need, Quality for Learners, and Destination Outcomes.  
There are a number of factors and measures we consider when setting outcome targets. Additionally, these targets may be set at different levels – for example at individual/learner, employer, sector and regional level. 
Impact Measurement and Outcome Analysis: Learners and Employers. Learner impacts are measured individually and across different data sets. Individually, we consider the impact on the learner of achieving the qualification in the context of their ability to occupy their role successfully and deliver value to their employer progression to the next level of learning. These are measured and recorded at the exit interview with the learner and employer and tracked through their individual learner record. 
We also consider the improved employability and behavioural skills, and their impact. This will be measured through enhanced job roles ie promotion or increased responsibility, progress towards these goals will be recorded at 10 weekly progress reviews and final progression at exit interview, all reviews are completed with the employee and the employer and tracked and recorded within the Employer Responsive Team. 
The Organisational Needs Analysis and associated Learning Plan identifies the agreed outcomes and business impacts agreed with employers. We measure the effectiveness of the training on the employer’s business objectives immediately post-achievement, and then again after an agreed period of time. This feedback loop and self-assessment for improving planning and delivery in future to employers is crucial, following the post-training review.
It will be the responsibility of the project delivery team to collate data on the monitoring metrics and generate quarterly reports for monitoring and evaluation review meetings incorporating local economic updates and data from the quarterly economic surveys.  
Starts vs. Achievements and Learner Retention. This is a key indicator and is directly relevant to the success of our provision. These are monitored on a weekly basis, with future achievement rates projected through our ProTarget application. This enables us to quickly identify any potential areas of concern to take remedial action if required in a timely fashion. This is important due to the correlation between apprentice achievement rates and employer satisfaction and impact. We also monitor retention by sector and qualification to ensure individual apprentices are satisfied, and to incorporate feedback from leavers to improve programmes. 
Learner Destinations. Progression KPIs are established at the beginning of the programme (whether in work, career progression or further qualifications) to ensure that our programmes are having a clear impact. We monitor this intelligence to inform the quality of both our curriculum delivery and the business consultancy we offer to employers at the beginning of the programme.
Future Numbers (Pipeline) and Forecasts. Our future numbers are monitored through a Business Development Pipeline. We build a detailed profile of planned sectors, frameworks and standards for the year, and build capacity accordingly. Monitoring our future pipeline and forecasts ensures that we balance this capacity with employer demand and keeps us on track to service those sectors and employers where we have identified demand through our various Labour Market Intelligence studies. Additionally, monitoring these KPIs ensures that capacity can be increased accordingly should there be additional demand in a particular area in-year.
Number of Students. Connected to the above, the number of students benefitting from our Apprenticeship programmes is monitored to ensure that our capacity and capability is adequate to meet employer demand at any time. 
Destination. Achievement gaps are reduced in several ways. First, by ensuring that students with particular needs receive appropriate information and guidance in order to fully determine additional support needs from the outset. Management data is produced monthly to compare performance (e.g. recruitment, retention, achievement, progression) of learners against targets to determine achievement gaps and deliver actions to reduce these. 
Desired progression (whether into work, career progression or further study) is agreed at the programme start, with a clear roadmap to further qualifications.




7. Management & Control7.1 Please describe whether or not the necessary team is in place to carry out the proposed activity in Greater Lincolnshire and if not what the plans are to recruit the relevant expertise? Please insert structure chart, if available.
Lincoln College has extensive experience of carrying out projects which require new build, refurbishment, purchasing of equipment and the reshaping of education and training. We have allocated staff to the project team and where necessary have held back on some appointments pending notification of further funding. 

Key points regarding the team are as follows:
* Proven track record: We will draw on our proven reputation of delivering high profile infrastructure and education projects and programmes both nationally and internationally. The project will include staff with experience of substantial new build programmes, as well as projects to transform existing parts of our estate. Our experience includes:
o Since 2016, opening five new micro-college campuses, in 2016 the Construction College in Gainsborough and the Air and Defence Career College in Lincoln and in 2019 the Lincoln Construction College, Care College and Policing College.  These offer employer-led, career focused education and technical training for 16 -19 year olds. 
o Since 2016 LCG mobilised five new further education colleges in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as part of the Colleges of Excellence programme,  providing teaching space for over 10,000 students.
o Newark Academy, we led the construction and relocation of the Academy to a brand new £15.5 million school as part of the Priority School Building Programme in 2015/16. 
o Deans Sport and Leisure, 2012/13 we opened one of the best sport facilities in Lincoln, offering fitness suites, squash and tennis courts, a spa and floodlit all weather pitches, as well an internet cafe, juice bar and many corporate facilities, such as conference and meeting rooms. 
o Made in Gainsborough, development of a bespoke Engineering training centre in conjunction with local employers.
* Strong project management experience: We have experience of operating collaboratively with multiple partners, and have extensive programme resources, knowledge, expertise and skills to deliver the project and mitigate associated risks. A project delivery plan is in place, with progress regularly monitored by our Group lead for projects using Prince 2 and Managing Successful Programmes (MSP) approaches.
* Project team: We will deploy a team of in-house expertise and externally sourced advisors to ensure the best mix of resources.
o Graham Harrison, Group Director of IT, Information Management and STEP will lead the project. 
o He will be responsible for implementing the project delivery plan. This will include key milestones, monitoring/reporting requirements, financial controls and a risk register. 
o He will report on progress direct to the College Executive Leadership Team on a monthly basis. 
o He will lead a multi-disciplinary project delivery team including the Group Head of Infrastructure, Facilities and Estates, the Vice Principal, Curriculum, and the Group Director of Finance and Commercial. 
o This project team will be supported by other College business support teams as appropriate. Any additional recruitment needs that may be required as the project progresses will be managed quickly and effectively by Lincoln College Group's in-house agency, FE Resources.


Equipment sourcing:
We will source any equipment purchases responsibly. Lincoln College will ensure that it follows the GLLEP's procurement requirements when selecting goods and services funded by the LEP. The College follows public sector procurement guidelines and has a procurement policy in place that details the regulations, responsibilities and accountabilities for the procurement of goods, services and works.

7.2 State Aid:  The Greater Lincolnshire LEP and its accountable body are required to ensure that funding complies with the rules on state aid. State aid is any advantage granted by public authorities through state resources on a selective basis to any organisations that could potentially distort competition and trade in the European Union (EU). If your project proposal constitutes state aid we will be unable to fund it unless you can demonstrate that it is outside the scope of or exempt from state aid rules. If you believe this to be the case please provide an explanation below. 
Lincoln College is a Further Education College which became incorporated under the 1992 Act of Parliament. The College has charitable status and its prime function is the provision of further and higher education.
State aid involves using funding from a public body to provide support in a commercial enterprise that might distort competition and affect trade in the EU. EU rules contain a number of exemptions which allow public bodies to intervene in the economy and to offer funding to address market failure. These exemptions allow public bodies to provide funding for a number of areas including education and initial pre-employment training and certain training aid with conditions around employer co-funding.
 
We consider that funding from the LEP for this project would not constitute state aid under EU regulations as the majority of the college’s activities fall under these exemptions.
