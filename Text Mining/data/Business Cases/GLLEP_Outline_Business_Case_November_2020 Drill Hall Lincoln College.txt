Project Summary
(Please keep as  brief as possible as this will be used for publicity purposes and uploaded onto the GL LEP website)* Economic Impact
Funding for this proposal will enable the refurbishment and reopening of one of the focal points for arts in the Greater Lincolnshire region, namely the Lincoln Drill Hall, creating a significant positive impact to the local economy enabling it to once again provide renewed support to the arts, local culture and the community groups.
A key tenet of that support will be the delivery of performing arts and creative media courses, vocational training programmes designed for the Visitor Economy sector and adult focused digital and functional skills qualifications.
Over the past 12 months, the tourism and hospitality industries have faced unprecedented challenges, with significantly decreased demand and many local businesses closing either temporarily or permanently. Like Visitor Economies worldwide, local businesses and attractions that rely on tourism have been significantly impacted by the decimation of visitor numbers over the past 12 months. This presents a need for increased productivity and space in order to reverse some of the damage from long-term revenue reductions and growth in unemployment.
The Drill Hall was one such business and it closed in March 2020 with all staff subsequently being made redundant, all grants ceasing, all events and services being cancelled and the doors locked. 
However, following conversations and planning meetings with the Lincoln Arts Trust, local theatre groups and producers, community groups, stakeholders, employers and the College curriculum team, we believe that the Drill Hall can become a self-sustaining, productive business providing economic and social value.
Investment and intervention in the Hall provides opportunity to increase capacity and capability on a large scale, refurbishing  10,690sqft of space. This proposal highlights how considered reinvestment in a well-known and well-loved building can strengthen both the local economy and quality of the visitor experience, as well as delivering employer-led, bespoke training for the sector that will:
* Increase productivity. 
* Provide employers with experienced, job-ready candidates for their vacancies.
* Upskill businesses in the use of digital marketing tools in order to improve customer interaction and modernise the sector.
* Increase the level of customer service offered across the region.
* Provide an investment in skills that the industry has requested for many years and is a recommendation of the Greater Lincolnshire Tourism Action Plan. 

As a GLLEP Priority Sector, the Visitor Economy is estimated to be worth £2.39 billion annually and supports more than 30,000 full time equivalent jobs. The outputs and outcomes described within this proposal directly address a number of key strategies for the Greater Lincolnshire Visitor Economy (as defined in the ‘Greater Lincolnshire Tourism Action Plan 2021 – 2025’).

The Drill Hall will be a multi-use centre, operating as an education and live-learning space, training centre, community centre and café during the day. In the evening the live learning continues as the Hall becomes a social space for everyone, offering delicious food, drinks and a broad range of entertainment.
As a live-learning space for 250 Lincoln College arts students, classes can be taught in traditional learning spaces but also in the auditorium, giving learners the chance to hone their craft whether it be performing, lighting, sound engineering, make-up or set-creation. Departmental performance at the College demonstrates clearly that achievement and attendance rates increase by over 10 percentage points when learning is carried out in a live setting of this kind and that applications to the courses often doubles.
Learning will also be delivered to adults from the Digital Community suite on the first floor of the building, giving access to a variety of digital skills and functional skills courses in a non-academic setting.
The venue will also host the “Best of Lincoln”, offering local food and drink suppliers the space to showcase their excellent produce. Renovation of the Hall and the development of a café/bar and food concessions will enable the venue to support local business growth and innovation, particularly those in the Food & Drink sector that have been significantly hit by the economic impact of the pandemic. Many SME’s have struggled over the past year and they would welcome the opportunity to promote their products and services more broadly.

Further positive economic impacts include:
* Offer a routeway to new employment opportunities.
* Creating bespoke employment routeways that will provide job-ready candidates to local businesses.
* Creation of new jobs (staffing for the Hall, work for local construction firms, source of income for local theatre companies).
* Re-imagine, accelerate and upgrade vocational education in the region.
* Offer new and exciting learning opportunities, incorporating live learning and ‘Learn and Earn’ principles.
* Deliver via a blended model - mix of digital and face to face, live learning, work experience placements and industry visits
* Support the post-Covid demands of the industry and the pace of tourism development within Greater Lincolnshire.
* Support the new era of tourism and cultural changes that are required in a post-pandemic world.
* Support the sector to adopt digital technologies and platforms which will enable them to improve productivity and attract more visitors.
* Investment in Creative Industries. The Hall will champion emerging talent and invest in creative, distinctive and entertaining work. 
* The development of an after-work culture will encourage talented people to move to the city, enhancing the productivity of our businesses.
* Remove the reliance of the Drill Hall on grants and funding from the City Council.
* Regenerate the city centre. The Hall is a central part of the Cultural Quarter in the City Centre. The venue has the ability to provide a huge variety of services and shows for the community and its visitors if the building is cared for and invested in rather than falling into further disrepair. 

(ii) How will the project deliver training and fill skills gaps to meet employer needs within the LEP priority sectors?

This proposal links very specifically with a number of LEP priority sectors to deliver training and industry specific skills. 

The Visitor Economy 

Reopening of the Hall will create 10,690sqft of commercial and educational space that delivers opportunity for course expansion and enrichment for a number of key industries operating in the Visitor Economy:

* Creative Industry
As a much loved venue, creative and cultural hub, the Drill Hall will once again re-establish itself at the heart of the cultural quarter, by providing additional space for high quality training in Performance, Music and Production Arts. Backstage Academy, alongside local companies like JMP and the Liz Hobbs Group have demonstrated that the growth in Level 3 and 4 production training and services have a viable and encouraging future. Currently healthy student numbers, and new subjects, will be further developed and expanded on with new premises and facilities, creating a flagship centre of arts education, locally, regionally and nationally.

Workshops and lessons will be held alongside the commercial offering giving learners the opportunity to develop skills that are so critical in the industry (networking, confidence, stamina and teamwork, to name a few). Access to the new performance space and technology as well as links with theatre companies from across the region, will contribute to the goal of producing a highly skilled and productive local workforce.

* Catering
The new operating model at the Hall will incorporate both the Lincoln College commercial and curriculum catering teams. The teams, who have already demonstrated their potential in Sincil Bank sports ground and the Sessions restaurant, will work together to offer students invaluable industry experience at the Hall. 
The College will also offer cookery classes for the general public abnd to small community groups, enabling people to benefit from learning to cook or fine tuning their skills with the help of our excellent catering teams. 

* Hospitality and Tourism
The Hall sells over ten thousand tickets a season in addition to company and events hire. This presents a fantastic complimentary offering to the Hospitality, Events, Arts and Tourism (HEAT) project, providing a city centre site with a substantial footfall to enhance skills training in Hospitality and Tourism qualifications. This, in turn, will mean learners are better placed, upon entering the job market, to understand local attractions, partnerships and interdependencies.

The ultimate goal of the training and skills outlined above is to inspire and support young people to stay and work in the area, by giving them the experience of working within a truly wonderful building in the centre of Lincoln. Our research also shows that live learning improves both attendance and achievement in 16-19 courses to levels over 95%.

* Adult Learning
Through relationships with local businesses, we understand there is also a demand locally for learning funded by the Adult Education Budget. Key focus points for AEB will be on Digital Skills and Marketing, Business Growth, IT skills (e.g. Digital Literacy, ECDL, Microsoft). These courses focus on training and supporting people, who may be working or seeking employment, to gain the skills needed to take up future job vacancies or improve their productivity. 

Two rooms within the Hall, currently unused due water ingress damage and services issues, will be refurbished to support the training and skills provision mentioned above. 

* Links to Ten Point Plan for a Green Revolution 

The project links to the ‘Greener Buildings’ goal within the 10 point plan:
* Greener buildings
The energy efficiency of the building is currently extremely inadequate. System and appliance obsolescence and disrepair means that considerable amounts of energy are lost through poor heating, ventilation and roofing.
The renovation works will include retrofitting and upgrading to parts of the building and its mechanical and electrical equipment to ensure the building is more energy efficient. Appliances will be replaced and lower carbon, more efficient, alternatives will be installed.

2. Project Need2.1 Why is the project needed in Greater Lincolnshire?
Lincoln Drill Hall has been a well-loved institution in the city centre since its opening in 1890. Unfortunately, over the past 10 years, the Hall has fallen into disrepair and has experienced financial challenges. The ambition at the very core of the Hall, to serve the community and provide space for the arts, has been lost due to its closure in 2020. This project is critical to providing the support and enrichment needed by many businesses, groups and individuals within the community. 

New Skills, Career Routes and Enrichment 

A letter from the House of Lords Communications and Digital Select Committee has emphasised that the impact of prolonged closures, due to Covid-19, may emphasise barriers to entering the performing arts for many, with special note to under-represented groups, which will damage arts education provision. In turn, this has a knock on affect for the “education and emotional recovery of children, young people, teachers, parents, and carers.”
In company with the new theatre programme, performances will often be accompanied by workshops and educational programmes. Performing and Productions Arts, Music and Media will continue to grow and develop courses from Level 2 to Level 4; workshops and lessons in the Hall will provide crucial enrichment for students and further opportunity for industry related courses in the field. It is Lincoln College’s vision to provide high quality education and training and making people exceptionally well prepared for work and, potentially, higher education. Enrichment activities are key to this vision and will enable focus on those essential skills needed in Performing Arts and Creative Industries (e.g. confidence in performing to large crowds, knowledge of related sectors and theatre management). Collaborative space will also generate new networks, industry links and space for like-minded people to work on future projects. 
Beyond the Performing Arts centre, the Hall will also provide experience and enrichment activities for students on Travel & Tourism, Hospitality and Catering courses. Work experience and learning opportunities will be available for those seeking to enter the events and leisure industries, offering apprenticeships and study programmes as well as short taster courses for those wanting to find out more about the industry and as mini-inductions for businesses such as the Showground, holiday parks and cinemas when seeking to employ temporary or seasonal staff.

The Visitor Economy

The reopening of the Drill Hall has many positive significant impacts on the local visitor economy, including addressing a number of known weaknesses. For instance, the Hall will offer a number of special events throughout the year to approach the issue of seasonality. Events and festivals will be planned that can contribute to place marketing and expanding the economic impact of tourism in Greater Lincolnshire. Events will be targeted at both local residents and visitors from outside the area, mapped against key seasonal or celebratory themes. Supplementary to this will be the opportunity for private and corporate events. The project incorporates a number of elements that support this aim, namely, weather proof changes to the outdoor space (located at the entrance on Free School Lane), new retractable audience seating (current seating is now non-functional) which will allow more seamless change in functionality, digital billboards for advertising events and general investment in the venue which will improve capacity for running special events. 

There will be the opportunity for students at Lincoln College to engage in some of these activities, as students of the Construction College will work together with the main contractor to plan and carry out the work, with particularly emphasis being given to work on a project that has sustainability and the Greener Buildings project. In addition, marketing students and creative media students will develop the marketing materials and campaigns for the programme of events at the Hall, the advertising of the adult learning opportunities and promotion of the daily community groups and sessions.

Learning opportunities at such a vibrant venue will be incredibly valuable to all students, as they will be given the opportunity to gain paid work experience in their chosen sector. In relation to front of house roles, events and catering opportunities this will directly benefit businesses by providing experienced job-ready candidates for their roles, thereby increasing productivity and revenue opportunities immediately. 

The project to refurbish the Hall will also be seen as an extremely beneficial step for the wider community. General public perception of Lincolnshire will be improved by the establishment of a significant contemporary attraction in the centre of the city as well as the reinvestment in an important building in the County’s history. The Hall will help to establish a clearer identity for Greater Lincolnshire by providing a venue for the Arts and for the community. Partnerships and links with key stakeholders and support organisations will contribute towards more collaborative relationships between local tourism businesses speaking with one voice and guaranteeing approaches that work collectively rather than individually (e.g. showcase events, experience packages). 

Supporting the Local Creative Economy 

The creative economy, which includes various occupations relevant to this proposal such as musicians, artists, performers and designers, has been hit hard by the Covid-19 crisis. With the sector being largely composed of micro-firms, non-profits, and creative professionals, often operating on the margins of financial sustainability, ongoing impacts of the pandemic have resulted in losses of sales of services, employment and earnings for those working in the sector. Arts, culture and creativity sectors are widely acknowledged as sectors that drive regional economies through visitor interaction and tourism. Unfortunately, if meaningful steps are not taken to limit the long term lasting damage to these industries, the effects of the pandemic will drastically undermine our culture, well-being and quality of life. 

The reopening and revitalisation of the Drill Hall gives us the opportunity to make a sustainable, positive support network for many individuals and businesses. Small scale measures will not undo the impact of Covid-19, but a substantial project to renew enthusiasm for the arts and local culture set in a well-known and well-loved building such as the Drill Hall, gives us the capacity and capability to rebuild what has been lost. 

Additionally, through the College’s partnership with NBV, the self-employment information, advice and guidance professionals, we will host workshops to benefit artists who are forming their own business and micro-businesses that require support. They will cover: 

* Cashflow forecasting and management.
* Tax. 
* Benefit awareness. 
* Budgeting.

Community, Arts and Culture

Arts and Culture offer numerous opportunities within a community for learning, leisure, entertainment, personal growth and connecting groups/individuals. There is a space in the county’s offering to provide a new and exciting programme of shows and events. Currently, there is no venue in Greater Lincolnshire that combines Arts, Culture and Community in a way that supports the lifecycle in the sector (from education to industry experience, professional networks to commercial delivery).

The Drill Hall will aim to be at the centre of the learning community, offering adult courses in a non-academic environment in the heart of the city, allowing those for whom schools and colleges have negative connotations to re-engage, and by appointing students to more than 50% of its paid roles, allowing them to ‘Learn and Earn’. More than 80% of students who have engaged in these opportunities previously gain permanent employment in the sector, whereas an average of only 30% of standard Study Programme graduates find employment in the sector linked to their course.

People need new opportunities to connect following the impact of Covid-19 through as many means as possible. The Hall represents a new start for the building as well as the community, as we move towards a post-pandemic era. The community and businesses in Greater Lincolnshire will benefit hugely from culture and creativity programmes that focus on social cohesion and boosting emotional well-being with the new delivery focusing on 

* peer support groups for mental health and wellbeing and signposting to professional services.
* community groups using the facilities for meetings and staff working with those groups to organise events that align with their needs. For example, mother and baby friendly afternoon tea sessions, charity fundraisers, gala dinners, awards ceremonies, trade shows and food collaborations.
2.2 What research or evidence has been undertaken to demonstrate the need, demand or impact of this project?  Please attach or provide links to completed studies and impact assessments where available.
The College has engaged with stakeholder individuals and groups representing the identified priority sectors in and around Lincoln. We conducted our research via:

* Focus groups.
* Roundtable discussions.
* 1-2-1 conversations.
* Consultation with supporting organisations and industry experts. 
* Desk based research.
* Online customer reviews.

We are keen to understand the missing elements in the county in the key areas identified, i.e. arts and performing arts, culture, community needs, social spaces (including food establishments), skills for target beneficiaries (identified in section 1.2) and how the reopening of the Hall can make a significant contribution to the visitor economy and mitigate effects of the pandemic for local businesses.

It was clear from speaking to the businesses that one of the biggest challenges is the diverse nature of the Visitor Economy sector, comprising hotels and other accommodation, restaurants and takeaways, bars and leisure services. It is also dominated by small establishments, many of which compete for customers and staff and as a result it is quite a volatile sector where staff move frequently. As a result, industry bodies and employers called for a level of stability and consistency within the industry. They wanted to be able to recruit staff who had been trained to a defined standard and to have access to continuous professional development training that would improve the quality and productivity of the business and provide the staff members with a sense of value and of embarking on a career.

The Drill Hall will help to provide that stability and consistency of message and industry standards to the learners who have the chance to work in one of the many ‘Learn and Earn’ roles. Students will be able to experience at first hand the demands of working on reception, as the front of house representative, how to manage and develop digital marketing messages, working in the catering areas on the bar or in the kitchen or serving customers, or to operating as a maintenance operative within a customer focused environment. The Drill Hall will serve to 

* Offer a pipeline of candidates to local employers for both full-time and part-time roles. 
* Ensure that candidates have relevant experience in the live learning environments.
* Support employers with succession planning and the opportunity to plan recruitment of students.
* Ensure that all students are motivated, engaged and enthusiastic and trained in soft skills.

Local production and theatre companies agree on the importance of the Hall to their own businesses, their employees’ income, freelance actors’ income, their supply chain and the youth and educational groups they work alongside. In short, the building is fundamental to the work and livelihoods of many people in the local performing arts sector. The Hall can maintain and support vital community services like Act Now and Rise & Shine, drama groups for adults with disabilities. This space is needed; the legacy of the Hall should be preserved and these opportunities should continue to be available for those who need it most.

In terms of skills and education, there are numerous ways that the offering at the Hall can support and enrich student programmes. Performing and Production Arts, Music and Media in Lincoln College have continued to grow and develop courses from Level 2 to 4 since 1999, today the College currently hold over 250 learners on these courses. Local companies like JMP and the Liz Hobbs Group have demonstrated that the growth in Level 3 and 4 production training and services have a viable and encouraging future. New subjects could be further developed and expanded on using the Hall’s facilities, creating a flagship centre of arts education, both locally and nationally and following in the footsteps of the Arts Depot in North Finchley, London and the Old Rep in Birmingham, which are both managed by educational institutions and combine arts and learning seamlessly.

Skills required by employers were grouped into three categories:

* industry-specific or vocational skills (mainly technical skills such as food production and preparation, stock management, cost control).
* generic skills (e.g. managerial skills, particularly small business management, communication, problem-solving, selling skills, literacy and foreign language competence).
* competence deriving from attitude to work (e.g. enthusiasm, commitment, the will to learn).

The Drill Hall operation will deliver learners with theoretical and practical experience of all of these areas, as students will be able to move around the business and experience a variety of different roles and those on the Level 3 Hospitality Supervisor course will have the chance to act as Duty Manager. Advertising the Drill Hall as a community venue and college-run facility will support this approach as will the size of the business, as it is big enough to offer a variety of experiences but not too big as to demand unrealistic expectations of our young people.

We will provide:

* a pipeline of job-ready, experienced candidates to local businesses.
* a venue to support the region’s arts businesses and organisations bounce back from Covid-19.
* adult skills provision in a non-academic setting.
* a focus on soft-skills training as identified as a priority by local employers.



2.3 Please explain how the project will deliver the strategic objectives of the Local Enterprise Partnership area and will demonstrate alignment with other local growth priorities.  Please include how you will deliver against the Local Industrial Strategy and the  Covid Recovery Plan
How will the project support the key principles of sustainable development – including Equality and Diversity assessments?  Will the scheme provide Net Zero Carbon solutions as part of its delivery?
Will it support the government's Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution
The project will focus on meeting the needs of Greater Lincolnshire through the refurbishment of the Lincoln Drill Hall, which will provide a venue for Arts and Culture and offer training and skills development to key industries operating in the Visitor Economy. The project will support the sector as follows:

* Early return on investment
The Drill Hall is a solution that delivers strong value for money and a quick return on investment. The Visitor Economy is a priority sector for Greater Lincolnshire LEP and the learning outcomes and work experience provided by Lincoln College in conjunction with the operation will deliver significant impact from as soon as Summer 2021.
* Direct response to the employers’ needs
The project responds to gaps in training and skills provision highlighted by employers (through research, interviews and focus groups) and by the Greater Lincolnshire Tourism Action Plan. In response to this feedback, we will support the delivery of vocational short and long courses from Level 2 through to Level 5. These solutions are critical conditions for growth. 
* Local Business Environment 
Renovation of the Hall will enable the venue to host and support many local businesses, particularly those in the Visitor Economy that have been hit hardest by the impact of the pandemic. Many SME’s have struggled over the past year and recognise the need to further raise awareness of the amazing products and services that are on offer locally. In this way, the Hall will help support business growth and contribute to sustainable sales that will enable businesses to grow and create new products and services.
* Producing career ready employees
The Drill Hall will effectively operate as an extended Sector-Based Work Academy Programme, providing Greater Lincolnshire employers in the Visitor Economy sector with high quality, experienced employees, with the skill sets that they have requested.
* Business start-up support: Through our partnership with NBV, the facility will provide support to help artists, performers and producers nurture their start-up business ideas, as well as offering guidance to new businesses which may be struggling following the pandemic.
* Increasing Productivity
This project will contribute significantly towards the visitor economy in the City Centre, specifically the Cultural Quarter. Providing a unique venue for local talent and producers to showcase to both residents and visitors. The venue has the ability to provide a huge variety of services and shows for the community and its visitors (more detail below under “Local Industrial Strategy: the five foundations of productivity”).
* Improving Infrastructure
Improving local infrastructure by investing in the Drill Hall means investing in the heritage, history and culture of Lincolnshire. The Drill Hall will be a special and distinctive space, capable of sparking pride and interest in the area once more. 
* Extending the Season
The reopening of the venue will help towards extending the tourist season by providing a diverse offering throughout the year to compliment other events locally. Events will be targeted at both local residents and visitors from outside the area, mapped against key seasonal or celebratory themes. Cookery classes with a particular focus e.g. winter fare, will be on offer as well as food and drink fares and tasting evenings.
* Sustainable Tourism
The reopening of the Drill Hall will generate economic benefits for local people and enhance the well-being of the community. Refurbishment of the Hall will improve working conditions for many, including access to the industry which will improve employment and productivity in the long term. Through relationships with a wide variety of businesses and organisations in the Visitor Economy, the Hall will ensure improved communication resulting in more meaningful connections and greater understanding of local cultural, social and environmental issues. 
* Partnership Working
At the very heart of the Drill Hall is the ultimate goal to provide a community and arts centre space for the local people. The Hall will champion emerging talent (producers, actors and musicians etc.) and invest in creative, distinctive and entertaining work. Through links with new delivery partners and supporting organisations, the Hall will work collaboratively to strengthen weak aspects of the Visitor Economy.
Local Industrial Strategy (LIS): the five foundations of productivity

The project will also focus on meeting the priorities of the LIS, focusing on the five foundations of productivity:
Ideas  
* Through creation of a new network of businesses and partnerships, the Hall will drive the ability for innovation locally and the capacity for small businesses to turn exciting ideas into strong commercial products and services. 
People  
* The project will focus on meeting business needs for talent, skills and labour by providing a number of AEB courses, tailored specifically to local business requirements, as well as engaging with local residents who might want to improve their skills but don’t want to enter a college campus.
* Providing additional space for high quality training in Performance, Music and Production Arts.
* Development of new courses, sitting in the Creative Industry, will remove barriers faced by many in the sector by providing a pathway into higher education from Levels 3 and 4. 
* Enriching the current curriculum offering with access to live learning, industry specialists and workshops that are proven to improve attendance and achievement.
* Providing learners with access to new technology as well as fostering links with theatre companies from across the region; this will contribute to the goal of producing a highly skilled and productive local workforce.
* The new operating model will incorporate commercial and curriculum catering teams, offering students invaluable industry experience, contributing to work readiness and opportunities for gainful employment.
* This project presents a fantastic complimentary offering to the Hospitality, Events, Arts and Tourism (HEAT) project, providing a city centre site with a substantial footfall to further enhance skills training.
* Providing inspiration and support to young people to encourage them to stay and work in the area, by giving them the experience of working within a truly wonderful, cared for, historic building in the centre of Lincoln. 
Infrastructure
* Reinvestment in a historical building in the heart of the Lincoln Cultural Quarter. 
* Providing the public, communities and businesses with a modern and accessible venue.
* Refurbishment of the Hall not only provides impact to the local economy but to long term productivity by ensuring greater certainty and strategic direction for all involved in the operations of the Hall.
* New facilities will boost the earning power of all our delivery partners and supporting organisations.
Business environment 
* The Hall will drive productivity in businesses by increasing collaboration, investing in skills & training and improving access to industry experts and projects. 
* Links between business and supply chain will be more efficient and effective. 
* Local and national talent will be welcomed, providing valuable input into the Hall’s programme and to wider tourism initiatives in Greater Lincolnshire. 
* The Hall will improve the vitality of the city centre and the structure of the urban fabric.
Place
* Investment in the Hall will facilitate access to skills and training for a large number of learners and businesses in the Visitor Economy.
* The reopening of the Hall is an opportunity for connecting infrastructure locally and to support innovation through network participation. 
* Reopening the main entrance will help reduce the number of inactive frontages on Broadgate and improve public access to Broadgate.
* It will improve connections between the city centre and adjacent neighbourhoods.
* It will strengthen the link between Free School Lane and the Cultural Quarter, ensuring an improved interaction of the cultural offer for Lincoln.
COVID-19 Recovery Plan
The project will also deliver against the COVID-19 Recovery Plan in the following ways:
* Workforce: 
The project will meet the changing employment and training needs of the workforce by offering bespoke programmes and AEB offers to individuals and local businesses. 
New pathways to careers in the Creative Industries will also work to boost a sector that has been significantly impacted by the effects of Covid-19.
Enriching education with industry skills to ensure courses continue to provide quality and relevance in a fast-paced and changing sector. Since April 2020, the number of benefit claimants in Greater Lincolnshire aged between 16 – 24 has quadrupled and the Drill Hall will offer a modern, exciting place to learn and a career pathway into the Visitor Economy sector. 
The Drill Hall will improve the region’s training infrastructure providing learners with the opportunity to put their skills into practice by means of paid work experience.
* Business Support:
Renovation of the Hall will enable the venue to support local business growth and innovation, particularly those in the Visitor Economy. The Hall will contribute to generating more high profile awareness of independent sellers which will improve revenue for small businesses, allowing them the opportunity to innovate and operate through tough financial circumstances. 
* Economic Intelligence: Improved communication between businesses to inform decision making that will strengthen the Visitor Economy through increased footfall and profitability (i.e. through innovation and partnerships). 
* Funding: The funding of this project constitutes an investment in local businesses and the economy. Businesses currently furloughed due to the pandemic will need access to a venue and equipment to support their return.

The project links to the ‘Greener Buildings’ goal within the 10 point plan:
* Greener buildings
The renovation works will include retrofitting and upgrading parts of the building and its mechanical and electrical equipment to ensure the building is more energy efficient. Appliances will be replaced and lower carbon, more efficient, alternatives will be installed.

Supporting sustainable development: The project will support the key principles of sustainable development by providing opportunities to allow everyone to fulfil their potential. It will provide employers with the skills they demand and require - now and in the future. Throughout the project we will:
* Carry out Equality and Diversity assessments.
* Promote equality and diversity.
* Monitor the use of resources
* Provide accessible training and skills provision.
* Meet the needs and aspirations of young people and the community. 
* Ensure that best practice is disseminated as widely as possible.
Sustainable Tourism: the project will teach that economic, social and environmental impacts are considered together and that a long-term view is taken to business development in the sector.

4. Options Analysis4.1 Why should the project receive LEP funding?
This project aligns with the GLLEP Strategic Economic Plan as discussed above.

The project is of strategic importance to GLLEP both as a standalone venue and in the broader context of kick-starting the Visitor Economy following the impacts of Covid-19.

Other significant outputs include:

* It supports business productivity and economic growth across priority sectors. 
* It provides training and experience in direct response to employer requests.
* The project develops a talent pipeline that provides a pool of skilled people to meet skills gaps and growth potential within the Creative Economy, Travel & Tourism, Hospitality & Tourism and Catering. 
* It nurtures industry links between students and professionals.
* The project provides an opportunity for the LEP to invest capital in infrastructure development that will have a transformational impact and make a significant contribution to the achievement of the LEP priority for growth in a priority sector, Visitor Economy. 
* The project will support the Health and Care (NHS, LPFT) sector to deliver their priorities, responding to needs in relation to health and wellbeing and supporting these through focusing on arts and creativity.


Value for Money

* Drill Hall will deliver outcomes from Summer 2021 providing a prompt return on investment and measurable impact on the Visitor Economy in Lincolnshire.
* The project is low risk- Lincoln College are an established organisation with expertise in delivering capital projects.

Employer led

* The Lincoln College mission statement is to be ‘Employer led; producing a highly skilled and productive local workforce.” 
* We have undertaken extensive consultation over the past 12 months in the development of this project. The Drill Hall responds directly to employers’ needs in relation to providing skilled, job-ready candidates for roles in the Visitor Economy. 



4.2 What other funding or delivery mechanisms have been considered to deliver the proposed activity?
Potential funding opportunities are limited for a project of this scale and without additional funding this project would be unable to proceed.

4.3 Additionality: What will the project deliver above and beyond what would happen anyway?
All of the outcomes discussed within this proposal will only exist if there is significant investment in the Drill Hall. Currently, the College is investing money into the safety critical requirements of the building to make it safe to enter. 
The outcomes of this project, outlined throughout this proposal, are summarised below: 
* A venue that can support and enrich curriculum through live learning, producing a highly skilled and productive local workforce. 
* Invest in the Digital Community suite to provide a city centre learning centre for adults.
* Enable offering of new FE courses, targeted at emerging skills gaps in the Visitor Economy.
* Increase student numbers, through improved capacity.
* Increasing productivity in the Visitor Economy specifically and the local economy more broadly.
* Creation of new jobs, apprenticeship opportunities and paid work experience placements at the Drill Hall.
* Investment in a social space that draws locals, visitors and industry talent.
* Capability to provide excellent performances, with functional equipment and audience seating.
* Ability to offer events, conferences, fairs, showcases, evening classes etc.
* Significant contribution to sustainable tourism and seasonality.
* Investment in key infrastructure.
* Mitigating the effects of Covid-19 on the Visitor Economy and businesses operating within the sector. 
* Usable performance space for theatre companies and charity groups.
* Creation of partnerships that support SME’s financial sustainability and ability to innovate.
* Regenerate the city centre, invest in the Cultural Quarter.
* Invest in heritage and history, improving people’s perception of the area and therefore encouraging more visitors. 
4.4 Scalability: What would happen if reduced LEP funding was available?
If reduced funding was available, the College would be unable to complete the refurbishment of the Drill Hall property therefore, the project would not happen.

Student Impact

Students would lose the opportunity to learn and work in an iconic cultural venue, thereby reducing the attraction of the courses and removing the opportunity to gain critical industry experience that would ignite their future career. 

With the Hall closed permanently, youth groups and community groups would be unable to use the facilities to attract participants and learners for their sessions, therefore, theatre groups would be likely to disband and young people would miss out on the inspiration to progress to full-time study.

The loss of the Digital Community suite would have a negative impact on the engagement of adults onto digital skills and functional skills courses.

Employer Impact

Employers would lose the pipeline of job-ready, experienced young people for their business which would adversely effect their productivity, the quality of their customer service and ultimately revenue generation.

Reduced Funding

If a reduced value of funding was made available we would be willing to enter discussions with GLLEP to determine best value for money, despite the significant risks to the feasibility of the project.

6.2 Please describe the rationale and assumptions you have made in establishing the outputs and results which will be achieved. This must link clearly to the project’s activity and objectives. Please explain your method for calculating the target levelsPublic Investment Leveraged (£)
Total capital borrowed for investment, and used to advantage in this proposal, is £269,500.78.
Number of New Jobs Created
Number of New Jobs is related to new roles created for the relaunch and running of the Hall. Whilst current staffing from the College will be involved, a number of new roles will be required. This is based on previous staffing models at the Hall and the organisational structure drafted in the business plan.
Number of Jobs Safeguarded
Safeguarded jobs include those employed by Theatre Companies, who are currently furloughed or out of work due to the pandemic. The reopening of the Hall provides a number of companies space and the opportunity to generate income from production.
Commercial floorspace refurbished and occupied/New training learning space refurbished (sqm)
Total calculated floor space to be refurbished, using architects’ floor plans of the Hall. The refurbishment of the Hall will create a venue with an ambition to merge commercial, community and curriculum. Hence, the project meets both outputs. 
Number of Businesses Assisted to Improve Performance
The reopening of the Hall will result in benefits to many small businesses across the county (the College intend to ensure its supply chain and business plan include as many independent sellers as possible). Specifically, improved customer awareness of products, additional revenue and, potentially, reduction in costs due to scalability.
Number of Learners Supported
Number of learners based on the number of students enrolled at Lincoln College who will have access to the venue to enrich their learning experience, develop additional skills, work readiness and industry links. 

6.3 Please outline how the project will gather and assess evidence of outputs and results, in line with the LEP's Monitoring and Evaluation Framework 
Lincoln College’s Group Director of IT & Projects will lead the project, he will be responsible for implementing a multi-disciplinary project delivery team ensuring that evidence of outputs and results of agreed monitoring metrics are gathered and assessed in line with the LEP’s monitoring and evaluation framework.
Lincoln College measures a variety of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to monitor and improve performance and assess evidence of outputs; these are recorded on the organisations Top Level Scorecard. 
These measures are interrogated and challenged at various levels, and in various forums. The groups, reviews and processes outlined below are integrated into the improvement cycle, ensuring that the College meets the needs of learners and employers. Regular assessment of success in the above areas allows us to make quick responsive decisions where there are tactical needs. They also allow us to formulate considered and evidence strategies for the future. These include our Employer Engagement Strategy which reflects the local skills needs and LEP priority sector areas, Change Management programmes and staff objectives and appraisals. 
Executive Leadership Team. Key measures are interrogated and discussed monthly by senior managers, based on the scorecard and dashboard.
Quarterly Performance Reviews. A formal review of performance in all relevant areas, led by the Chief Executive, is intended to provide assurance and development in key areas, with agreed actions to make improvements where necessary.  
Managing Directors Reviews. Monthly reviews of performance, led by the MD of Education and Training and attended by the Director of Apprenticeships, Director of Employer Provision and Director of Planning and Performance. 
Monthly Funding Meetings. Focused on important funding and compliance KPIs, provides scrutiny over learner numbers and income performance, and mitigating actions are agreed here where required. College targets are to exceed National averages timely and overall framework achievement by 3%.
Fortnightly Review Meetings. The Head of Apprenticeships & WPL and Training & Skills Leads meet fortnightly to review all data, applications, enrolments, retention and achievements. Any problems are discussed and support is put in place for ‘at risk learners’.  Apprenticeship data and KPIs are reviewed by the Employer Provision management team on a monthly basis.

KPIs form the basis of both the College’s Apprenticeship strategy and operational plan as well as individual performance objectives. The majority of the College’s KPI’s align with the LEP’s monitoring and evaluation framework, however if there is something more specific we would comply and ensure that monitoring is established.  There are several key measures evaluated that cover three important areas: Responsiveness to Employer Need, Quality for Learners, and Destination Outcomes.  
There are a number of factors and measures we consider when setting outcome targets. Additionally, these targets may be set at different levels – for example at individual/learner, employer, sector and regional level. 
Impact Measurement and Outcome Analysis: Learners and Employers. Learner impacts are measured individually and across different data sets. Individually, we consider the impact on the learner of achieving the qualification in the context of their ability to occupy their role successfully and deliver value to their employer progression to the next level of learning. These are measured and recorded at the exit interview with the learner and employer and tracked through their individual learner record. 
We also consider the improved employability and behavioural skills, and their impact. This will be measured through enhanced job roles ie promotion or increased responsibility, progress towards these goals will be recorded at 10 weekly progress reviews and final progression at exit interview, all reviews are completed with the employee and the employer and tracked and recorded within the Employer Responsive Team. 
The Organisational Needs Analysis and associated Learning Plan identifies the agreed outcomes and business impacts agreed with employers. We measure the effectiveness of the training on the employer’s business objectives immediately post-achievement, and then again after an agreed period of time. This feedback loop and self-assessment for improving planning and delivery in future to employers is crucial, following the post-training review.
It will be the responsibility of the project delivery team to collate data on the monitoring metrics and generate quarterly reports for monitoring and evaluation review meetings incorporating local economic updates and data from the quarterly economic surveys.  
Starts vs. Achievements and Learner Retention. This is a key indicator and is directly relevant to the success of our provision. These are monitored on a weekly basis, with future achievement rates projected through our ProTarget application. This enables us to quickly identify any potential areas of concern to take remedial action if required in a timely fashion. This is important due to the correlation between apprentice achievement rates and employer satisfaction and impact. We also monitor retention by sector and qualification to ensure individual apprentices are satisfied, and to incorporate feedback from leavers to improve programmes. 
Learner Destinations. Progression KPIs are established at the beginning of the programme (whether in work, career progression or further qualifications) to ensure that our programmes are having a clear impact. We monitor this intelligence to inform the quality of both our curriculum delivery and the business consultancy we offer to employers at the beginning of the programme.
Future Numbers (Pipeline) and Forecasts. Our future numbers are monitored through a Business Development Pipeline. We build a detailed profile of planned sectors, frameworks and standards for the year, and build capacity accordingly. Monitoring our future pipeline and forecasts ensures that we balance this capacity with employer demand and keeps us on track to service those sectors and employers where we have identified demand through our various Labour Market Intelligence studies. Additionally, monitoring these KPIs ensures that capacity can be increased accordingly should there be additional demand in a particular area in-year.
Number of Students. Connected to the above, the number of students benefitting from our Apprenticeship programmes is monitored to ensure that our capacity and capability is adequate to meet employer demand at any time. 
Destination. Achievement gaps are reduced in several ways. First, by ensuring that students with particular needs receive appropriate information and guidance in order to fully determine additional support needs from the outset. Management data is produced monthly to compare performance (e.g. recruitment, retention, achievement, progression) of learners against targets to determine achievement gaps and deliver actions to reduce these. 
Desired progression (whether into work, career progression or further study) is agreed at the programme start, with a clear roadmap to further qualifications.
7. Management & Control7.1 Please describe whether or not the necessary team is in place to carry out the proposed activity in Greater Lincolnshire and if not what the plans are to recruit the relevant expertise? Please insert structure chart, if available.
Lincoln College has extensive experience of carrying out projects which require new build, refurbishment, purchasing of equipment and the reshaping of education, training and commercial ventures. 

Key points regarding the team are as follows:
* Proven track record: We will draw on our proven reputation of delivering high profile infrastructure and education projects and programmes both nationally and internationally. The project will include staff with experience of substantial new build programmes, as well as projects to transform existing parts of our estate. Our experience includes:
o Since 2016, opening five new micro-college campuses, in 2016 the Construction College in Gainsborough and the Air and Defence Career College in Lincoln and in 2019 the Lincoln Construction College, Care College and Policing College.  These offer employer-led, career focused education and technical training for 16 -19 year olds. 
o Since 2016 LCG mobilised five new further education colleges in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as part of the Colleges of Excellence programme,  providing teaching space for over 10,000 students.
o Newark Academy, we led the construction and relocation of the Academy to a brand new £15.5 million school as part of the Priority School Building Programme in 2015/16. 
o Deans Sport and Leisure, 2012/13 we opened one of the best sport facilities in Lincoln, offering fitness suites, squash and tennis courts, a spa and floodlit all weather pitches, as well an internet cafe, juice bar and many corporate facilities, such as conference and meeting rooms. 
o Made in Gainsborough, development of a bespoke Engineering training centre in conjunction with local employers.
* Strong project management experience: We have experience of operating collaboratively with multiple partners, and have extensive programme resources, knowledge, expertise and skills to deliver the project and mitigate associated risks. A project delivery plan is in place, with progress regularly monitored by our Group lead for projects using Prince 2 and Managing Successful Programmes (MSP) approaches.
* Project team: We will deploy a team of in-house expertise and externally sourced advisors to ensure the best mix of resources.
o Graham Harrison, Group Director of IT, Information Management and STEP will lead the project. 
o He will be responsible for implementing the project delivery plan. This will include key milestones, monitoring/reporting requirements, financial controls and a risk register. 
o He will report on progress direct to the College Executive Leadership Team on a monthly basis. 
o He will lead a multi-disciplinary project delivery team including the Group Head of Infrastructure, Facilities and Estates, the Vice Principal, Curriculum, and the Group Director of Finance and Commercial. 
o This project team will be supported by other College business support teams as appropriate. Any additional recruitment needs that may be required as the project progresses will be managed quickly and effectively by Lincoln College Group's in-house agency, FE Resources.

Delivery Team
A  delivery team will be recruited to assist with the operational management of the Drill Hall. This will include Technical Managers, Stage and Lighting Technicians, Front of House, Bar Staff, Security and a Site Manager. 

Equipment sourcing:
We will source any equipment purchases responsibly. Lincoln College will ensure that it follows the GLLEP's procurement requirements when selecting goods and services funded by the LEP. The College follows public sector procurement guidelines and has a procurement policy in place that details the regulations, responsibilities and accountabilities for the procurement of goods, services and works.


7.2 State Aid:  The Greater Lincolnshire LEP and its accountable body are required to ensure that funding complies with the rules on state aid. State aid is any advantage granted by public authorities through state resources on a selective basis to any organisations that could potentially distort competition and trade in the European Union (EU). If your project proposal constitutes state aid we will be unable to fund it unless you can demonstrate that it is outside the scope of or exempt from state aid rules. If you believe this to be the case please provide an explanation below. 
Lincoln College is a Further Education College which became incorporated under the 1992 Act of Parliament. The College has charitable status and its prime function is the provision of further and higher education.
State aid involves using funding from a public body to provide support in a commercial enterprise that might distort competition and affect trade in the EU. EU rules contain a number of exemptions which allow public bodies to intervene in the economy and to offer funding to address market failure. These exemptions allow public bodies to provide funding for a number of areas including education and initial pre-employment training and certain training aid with conditions around employer co-funding.
 
We consider that funding from the LEP for this project would not constitute state aid under EU regulations as the majority of the college’s activities fall under these exemptions.





















7.3 Please explain the key risks identified for the project and how these will be managed and mitigated throughout the project.  Please attach separate risk register, if available.

Mitigation/ActionDelays with refurbishmentGroup Head of Infrastructure, Facilities and Estates and Project Manager34The project will be tendered with a mandatory completion date for all contractors, based on the schedule. Contingency snag weeks will be incorporated into the schedule. Emphasis will be given to critical activities to prevent any knock-on delays. The College have the option to increase resource on a number of activities should it be required, resources will be planned ahead into forecast activities.Availability of specialist equipmentProject Manager22The specialist equipment included in the project relates to equipment for the main auditorium. Through links with local production companies, the College will be able to reduce this risk. It will also be mitigated through short term loan of equipment if absolutely necessary (but this is highly unlikely).Accidents on siteGroup Head of Infrastructure, Facilities and Estates25All site works will be undertaken following strict risk assessments and method statements. Site inductions and a site safety log will be generated prior to the start of any activity. The Site Manager will brief and debrief all on site to ensure all contractors are aware of ongoing activities and any risks. Relevant PPE checks will be carried out daily. Cost exceeds estimatesProject Manager34Projected costs are based on suppliers' quotes costs following extensive surveys of the building. Robust tendering procedures will enable competitive prices for to be secured. The project manager will be responsible for managing the costs and ensuring that the outcomes are achieved. Impact of Covid-19Project Manager34The impact of Covid-19 produces an increased element of insecurity for all projects. For this in particular, there should be limited impact to construction activities should the current regulations persist. There may, however, be an indirect backlog of work for contractors which results in longer lead times for site start. This will be incorporated into the tendering process which will be initiated as soon as practically possible with budgetary tenders accepted in the first instance to prevent delays. 
There are risks to the start date of relaunch for the general public. The College will monitor the situation closely with supporting bodies and information from the government. Provisional programmes will be created and amended if required. At all times, the safety of the public and staff is priority 1. Public Awareness of ReopeningProject Manager & Head of Marketing24Currently the College are waiting for confirmation from the Charity Commission that the Hall will be transferred to the College (ETA 28th February 2021). Once this confirmation is received, the College will make a formal public announcement. It will be imperative that in this announcement the College make it clear that the Hall is not to be an educational facility but continue to be a public space, for Arts, Culture and Community, supported by education and training.
